1. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
AHMEDABAD ,

May 21 [1915]
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Here am I now hoping to settle down. The boys are at the
Gurukul, Hardwar, I have wired for them and they may be here any
day. Two cottages have been placed at my disposal. They are isolated
from this big city. There are 3 acres of ground attached to them.
Living there I shall conduct the Institution1 along our lines and shall
search for an agricultural plot.
I pleaded for admission to the Society after Mr. Gokhale’s
death as I knew that such was his wish. 2 Of course, my admission
could not mean any alteration of my views. They are too firmly fixed
to be altered. I find here nothing but confirmation. I am passing
through a curious phase. I see around me on the surface nothing but
hypocrisy, humbug and degradation and yet underneath it I trace a
divinity I missed there as elsewhere. This is my India. It may be my
blind love or ignorance or a picture of my own imagination. Anyway
it gives me peace and happiness. It fills me with hope and confidence
without which no man could work.
I wonder if you will stick to your carpentry and restaurantkeeping. Both are good education. Your diary does not even give me
an idea of your monthly expenses. Does Polak continue to give you
satisfaction by way of letters?
Do you do any reading at all? Have the rosary and Imitation of
Christ disappeared from your view entirely?
With love,

CHI. UMIYASHANKER,

I have your letter. I returned only yesterday, after visiting Rajkot
and Limbdi. I have no personal relation with Hussain Tyobji so that I
could write to him. However, Chhabildas should apply immediately, or
you may do so on his behalf. You . may mention my name and say
that I know him well and will be ready to give a guarantee [on his
behalf]. If he then inquires of me, I shall be able to say something.
Have you done anything about what you were to send me
concerning Chhotu?

I find I have been away from the students too long and should not
therefore leave at once. I must therefore look for another occasion to
visit Surat.

DEAR MR. NATESAN,

I have your letter enclosing cheque for Rs. 3,000 for which
please find receipt herewith.
I notice that the Bangalore ‘talk’ has been much misrepresented
and that Mrs. Besant has done me no justice whatsoever. I saw the
‘talk’ only the day before yesterday and it is a parody of what I
actually said. I never sent Mrs. Besant any explanation for publication
I now hear that she has published what purports to be an explanation
from me. Could you please send me the copies if you have seen them.

DEAR MR. VEERASWAMI,

You may come here at any time you like and you will stay if we
mutually agree. . . .1 now nothing is obligatory. English books are
stocked here in a large quantity and newspapers are also received.
Those who are in the Institution2 do write letters and stamps or
post-cards are provided for them. The rest can be discussed personally
if you decide to come. Servants of India Society may not admit you
as you are only a matriculate.
Yours truly,

DEAR SIR,

Mr. Natesan1 has sent me your letters addressed to him and to
me. I thank you for both. Your son2 has been in correspondence with
me. His last letter stated that he was driven away by you. I therefore
wrote to him yesterday saying that in that case he was free to come to
me. His ultimate aim seems to be to join the Servants of India Society.
If your boy comes here and is found to be not of mature age so far as
I am concerned he will be certainly sent back to you. I take no
boysunder age without the consent of their parents. You may
therefore fully depend upon my co-operation with you.

8. LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI
Vaishakh Vad 7 [June 4, 1915]
CHI. MAGANLAL,

I have your letter. I see that you are rather upset. The fault, I am
sure, is mine. In attempting to ride too many horses at a time, I am in
danger of falling off all of them. I have not quite, for my enthusiasm
proceeds from an eager desire for service. I may not, however, be able
to hold on long if I continue to go the way I am doing, forgetting all
about service. Be patient. I intend to send you all, on suitable
occasions, to different places, so that you may see things for
yourselves. Everything will depend on what help we get and how
many we can have with us here. I am perfectly confident of this, at
any rate, that I shall satisfy the aspirations of you all; meanwhile, I do
feel that the life you have all led so far has not been in vain, that, on
the contrary, you have learnt much.
I am not unaware that you have not attained to a state of perfect
non-attachment, for I have not attained it myself and I know that you
are yet to reach even my level. If we stop making noise about the
vows, we shall “not find ourselves in unhappy situations as we
occasionally do. And now one question. Explain to me what you
mean by “not having attained to a state of perfect non-attachment”. I
can explain [how that is so with me]. For example, I observe
brahmacharya, but not in all its subtle aspects. I cannot say that my

mind or eyes are never disturbed.
2. I maintain truthfulness, but I cannot say that I am never guilty of
exaggeration, consciously or unconsciously. To say what I like saying
and not to say anything which I do like saying casts a shadow on the
vow of truthfulness.
3. I make untiring efforts to control the palate but I observe that I
extract the utmost pleasure from the five articles [I permit myself in a
day]. But I do want to keep these and other vows inviolate and make
progress in them day by day, and I am quite confident that 1 shall
succeed. I feel that I am not likely now to depart from a literal
observance.1

Vaishakh Vad 8 [June 5, 1915] 2
RESPECTED SHRI RANCHHODBHAI,

Having been very busy with various affairs, I could not write
earlier. Those at Hardwar were expected to arrive any day and so I
could not go to Gondal nor could I stay on [at Rajkot]. I have taken
up residence in two bungalows here. Efforts [for acquiring land] will
now be taken up. Boarding expenses have to be found by me.
Utensils. tools, etc., have been supplied by Ahmedabad. Things have
not made as much progress as we would have liked, for the various
articles take a long time in arriving.
Could you send from there someone to teach [us] how to
operate an indigenous loom? Could you secure me such a loom and
some sample of handloom cloth woven on it?
Do you know any teacher, a man of character, who can teach
Sanskrit and Gujarati? We may pay him. We shall be satisfied if we get
one for a short period.

From the references to the arrival from Hardwar of Maganlal Gandhi’s party at

AHMEDABAD ,

Vaishakh Vad 13 [June 10, 1915] 1
RESPECTED SHRI RANCHHODBHAI,

I wrote to you yesterday in the midst of many preoccupations. I
think some of your questions I should answer right now. I have a little
time on hand today and, since I leave for Poona in the evening, I set
down a few things this very moment.
There need be no congratulations on [the award of] the
Kaiseri-Hind medal.2 One may get it and also lose it. I do want a
medal, but of a different kind altogether. There is no knowing when I
shall get it, if ever.
The English article which is sold as flour is often no flour but a
mixture of other things. There is fraud in [the sale of] this article. The
retailer, being a third party, may not perhaps be involved in it.
Handloom cloth is only an example. The vow of swadeshi implies that
every article should be swadeshi. Kindly permit me to say that the
observance of this vow has a subtle moral bearing.
Arithmetic will certainly include oral sums and Indian
accountancy.
It cannot be that Gujaratis will never look outside Gujarat. They
will go everywhere in India. They are to serve the nation. If they do
not know the languages of Madras, they can have no contact with the
people there. As for English, it can be of service only to those who
know English. Shankar3 had learnt all the languages of India.
Vallabh4 , who belonged to the land of the Dravids, had learnt Gujarati.

This was written on the next day after “Letter to Ranchhodlal Patwari”,

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

There are at present hundreds of Gujaratis in Madras who know
Tamil. [In] Europe, people in the various countries know four or five
European languages. It is very easy to acquire such proficiency in
languages. The time wasted over English will, if saved, be sufficient
for the purpose of these other languages.
Pupils are to receive education which will incline them to do
nothing but national service when their studies are over. If, on
growing up, they leave the Ashram, the education will have failed to
that extent. Should any occasion of the kind arise, the student will be
free [to follow his inclination]. It is not the aim, however, that the
students should return to their parents and get lost in the sea of
practical affairs.
I have had bitter experience that, when provision is made for
exceptional circumstances, parents conveniently fall ill. While they are
still in the stage of brahmacharya, students must not go to attend
marriages. They are to be surrounded with a new kind of atmosphere
and I always feel that, if there is frequent breaking away from this,
building of character is impossible.
As for dress, a single uniform is prescribed for the present, it
being necessary to do this for several reasons.
I think I have given very deep thought to the subject of milk. It
is a legacy of our non-vegetarian past. It is objectionable from so
many points of view that it ought to be avoided altogether. Quite a
number of boys have gone through the experiment for several years
and I have observed no ill-effects on their health. More [about this]
when we meet.
I shall try to respect people’s sentiments in every way I can
without compromising the aims of the Ashram.
We have secured four teachers. One of them will stay with us.
Others live in the neighbourhood and come over daily for teaching. If
a teacher is not a man of character, he will be of no use to us.
Respectful greetings from

AHMEDABAD ,

June 15 [1915] 1
MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have your letter. The omission of your dairy altogether is, I
feel, a retrogression. It was a good measure of discipline. Your diary
gave me an insight into yourself for that particular week as nothing
else could. Do please therefore resume your diary if you can.
This has been a sad week. Bombay has so weighed me down that
I am in a most melancholy mood. If I had to live in Bombay for one
year, I would die. I am glad just now you are not with me. I go about
barefoot. There is hardly a road clean enough to make you feel safe
about your tread. This has not got on my nerves so much hitherto
because I have not had the opportunity of walking much. And the
closets! I know you would vomit eternally if you merely looked at
them. Now what is the duty of a reformer in this position? Can the city
life be mended? If not, can he by working in a city perpetuate the
life? Suppose he succeeded in getting clean roads and clean closets,
not by any means an easy task, what will he have gained? How is he to
deal with the filth within? How will he regulate the morality of the
people? These are awful questions and I have to answer them, you
have to answer them.
The enclosed is a partial or complete answer. Read it carefully
and criticize freely and fully.2 I will send you more copies later. I have
a limited number by me here.
The life at Ahmedabad is good. There you would be perfectly at
home. The boys are making progress. Only Mrs. Gandhi causes

19. LETTER TO J. B. PETIT1
AHMEDABAD ,

June [16] 2 , 1915
DEAR MR. PETIT,

I beg to submit herewith an account of the income and
expenditure as up to the 31st January 1915 in connection with the
passive resistance movement in South Africa.
Publication of the account has been delayed beyond my desire
and expectation. It was Mr. Gokhale’s intention that the accounts
should be published along with a statement about the disposal of the
balance in hand. As he was the prime mover in India and remained in
closest touch with the movement to the end, I never did anything
without consultation with him, and through him with your Committee.
It was his intention that before the accounts were finally published, I
should confer with your Committee. The cruel hand of Death having
removed him from us, the matter of publication has been further
delayed, and it is only now that it has become possible to submit the
accounts to the public.
1

This was sent to the addressee, Jehangir Bomanji Petit, who was Secretary of
the South African Indian Fund, as a draft. It was eventually printed and made public on
October 31, 1915, with additions and alterations indicated in footnotes.
2
Vide “Diary for 1915”.

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

The income includes not only the monies received through you
but includes also those received from Madras, Rangoon, London and
various parts of Africa, Passive Resistance School, etc. Thus, of the
£27,324.0.7, £8,424.0.7 were monies other than those received
through you.
As to expenditure, there are some items which require
explanation. Relief which takes up nearly £3,000/- means assistance
given to Passive Resisters or their families, and it is a recurring
item. There are widows of Passive Resisters who died during the
struggle without leaving anything for those left behind them. There
are children of Passive Resisters and Passive Resisters themselves who
require support.1 Farm upkeep and improvements mean expenses in
connection with the Phoenix Settlement which became the Passive
Resistance Farm after the transference to Phoenix of Passive Resisters
from Tolstoy Farm belonging to Mr. Kallenbach. Phoenix Settlement
consists of 100 acres of land originally bought by me for locating the
printing works of Indian Opinion. Though the legal title vested in me
for some years, I never made personal use of the property. During the
struggle, however, I divested myself of the legal title and it is now held
by Trustees for public purposes defined in a registered Trust deed. 2
This property is still being used for housing Passive Resisters or their
families. Settlers who are living on the land receive no wages but take
out of the income from Indian Opinion, and other sources just
enough for their maintenance. The journal has never been and can
never become an entirely self-supporting proposition. The English
portion of it is mainly of an educative character for the European
public amongst whom it is distributed gratis. It was a powerful weapon
in the armoury of Passive Resistance and continues to be the only
recorder of accurately sifted facts about our countrymen in South
Africa and of Passive Resistance movement. It is in no sense a
commercial enterprise. This settlement will still need assistance.3
The third item is Valiama Hall. This is an institution founded in
the memory of the late Valiama, a girl of 17 who died shortly after
her discharge from prison of fever contracted therein. Its use will be
1

The published letter here adds: “For these, disbursements will still have to be

made.”

chiefly educational. The Tamil portion of our countrymen have
suffered most. Johannesburg is one of the largest Indian centres. It
gave the largest number of Passive Resisters, and the Tamils were the
foremost among them. The late sister belonged to Johannesburg. No
better use of the Passive Resistance funds could be conceived than to
have a permanent hall in Johannesburg for the public needs of the
community. The institution will be registered in the name of Messrs
Kachalia, the Chairman of the British Indian Association, Thambi
Naidoo and Polak for the purposes mentioned above. This will cost
probably £4,000. I hope that this disposal of the funds will commend
itself to your Committee as being strictly in accordance with the
purposes for whichthe monies were sent to South Africa, namely, relief of
Passive Resisters and furtherance of the struggle. The available balance
should, in my opinion, remain as it has done, in the names of Messrs
A. H. West and Maganlal K. Gandhi as a trust with instructions to
utilize the funds from time to time for furtherance of measures being
adopted to secure just administration of local laws and the removal of
the remaining disabilities and for relief of Passive Resisters, if further
relief than what I have already adverted to is necessary. Co-operation
of Messrs Cachalia, Parsee Rustomjee and other Passive Resisters is
sought whenever extraordinary expenditure has to be incurred.1
Whilst the actual courting of imprisonment has ceased, the
struggle for removal of the remaining disabilities itself has by no
means ceased and this brings me to a brief statement of its results.2 In
its last stages, nearly 25,000 Indians actively participated in it, that is,
one sixth of the total Indian population in South Africa. The balance
of the community practically but with few exceptions supported the
struggle whether by contributions in cash or in kind or by holding
meetings in support3 , etc. It began in the Transvaal with the passing of

In the published letter, this paragraph is replaced by the following:
“Bulk of the unexpended balance, viz., Rs. 215,000 has been cabled to me
from Durban. In accordance with the desire of your Committee, I have handed this sum
to you. In my opinion, the saving of such a large sum shows that utmost economy
has been used in handling the funds.
It is perhaps necessary at this stage to give in its briefest outline an account of
the struggle to the maintenance of which the mother country contributed so
generously.”

In the published letter, this sentence reads: “Whilst the actual courting of
imprisonment has ceased, the struggle itself has by no means ended.”

the now famous Asiatic Registration Bill in the year 1906, but as year
after year the struggle rolled on with temporary settlements, it
included many other things besides the Asiatic Registration Act, and
covered the whole of South Africa till at the time of the settlement the
points in Passive Resistance were as follows:1
(1) Repeal of the Asiatic Act.
(2) Removal of the racial or colour disqualification as to
immigration from the Union legislation.
(3) Removal of the legal disabilities of Indian wives.
(4) Removal of the annual Poll Tax of £3, which was payable
by ex-indentured Indians, their wives and grown-up
children.
(5) Just administration of existing laws with due regard to
vested rights.
All these points are covered by the settlement of the last year
which are considered2 to be a complete vindication of Passive Resistance
and I venture to state that if more has not been gained, more was not
and could not be asked 3 for as an item in Passive Resistance, for a
Passive Resister has to frame his minimum as well as his maximum and
he dare not ask for more nor can he be satisfied with less.
But I do not wish to be understood to mean that nothing further
remains to be done in South Africa, or that everything has been
gained. We have only fought for removal of legal disabilities as to
immigration, but administratively it tells more heavily upon us than
other nations. In accepting administrative inequality, we have given
due regard to existing conditions and prejudices.4 We fought to keep
the theory of the British Constitution intact so that practice may some
day approach the theory as near as possible. There are still certain
laws in South Africa, for instance, the Law 3 of 1885, Trade Licence
Laws of the Cape and Natal which continue to cause worry.

Administration of the Immigration Law is not all it should be. For
these, however, Passive Resistance [is not] applied and is at present
inapplicable, its application being confined to grievances which are
generally felt in a community and are known to hurt its self-respect or
conscience. Any of our 1 grievances referred to by me may any day
advance to that stage. Till then only the ordinary remedies of petition,
etc., can be and are at present being applied 2 . Letters received from
South Africa show that difficulties are being experienced in some
cases acutely by our countrymen and if not much has been heard of
them in India just now, it is because of the extraordinary self-restraint
of our countrymen in South Africa during the crisis that has
overtaken the Empire.
This struggle has defined principles and removed disabilities
which were in the shape of a national insult. The larger question of the
treatment of British Indians who came there3 from outside can only be
dealt with here4 and for the question of the local disabilities still
unredressed, your Committee will have to exercise a ceaseless watch
and assist as heretofore the efforts of our countrymen in South Africa.
I feel that I ought to place on record my strong conviction,
based upon close personal observation extending over a period of
twenty years, that the system of indentured emigration is an evil which
cannot be mended but can only be ended. No matter how humane the
employers may be, it does not lend itself to the moral well-being of
the men affected by it. I therefore feel that your Committee should
lose no time in approaching the Government of India with a view to
securing entire abolition of the system for every part of the Empire.
Before closing, I am bound to mention that the struggle would
not have ended so soon and even as satisfactorily as it did, but for the
generous support rendered by the Motherland under the leadership of
the great and saintly patriot whose death we all mourn and but for the
very sympathetic and firm attitude taken by the noble man who at
present occupies the Viceregal chair.

MU. BHAISHRI KHUSHALJIVAN GANDHI,

For some time, 1 have been thinking about Chi. Narandas. That
ultimately he is to live with me is his own desire as also yours and
mine. My only purpose in employing Narandas in a job is that
thereby he should earn something and contribute to your expenses. I
feel that you should fix the figure of your needs, and that I should
meet them and that you should then free Narandas. The Ashram
needs one or two persons. If Narandas comes, the need will be met. I
am looking for someone whom I can engage as a paid assistant. Why
should I then not give the opportunity to Narandas? Maganlal and
Manilal are kept fully occupied with the teaching of Sanskrit and they
are quite engrossed in it. This being so, we are short of teachers. On
myself also, I have placed an excessive burden, with the result that I
have to leave undone some other things which require my attention.
Hence, if Narandas joins me, I will be saved from many difficulties.
Please do not think of the matter from a purely worldly point of
view. Consider only what is good for Narandas and for us all in
coming to a decision.
Since Narandas also will read this letter, I am not writing to him
1
From the reference to Narandas, it appears that this letter was written before
the one to the addressee dated September 24, 1915. Jeth Sud 11 in the year 1915

AHMEDABAD ,

June 25 [1915] 1
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Your letters, last two, have been brief and contained a trace of
bitterness. The bitterness was due to the brevity of my letters. But if
you knew the rush under which I have been living you would not have
grumbled. You might have imagined that during that time the letters
to you were the only writing work that I probably did. I hope however
that your next letter will be less gloomy.
Your overlooking the diary is a fatal omission. The omission too
is partly due, I fear, to anger. But it is again a fall. Do please resume
the diary.
I am having extraordinary difficulties. I do not know that what
they mean. I can only hope that they will chasten us all. The
difficulties arise from our strangely simple life. The people around us
do not understand us. There is one man who strikes and swears at the
boys and prevents them even from using water we are entitled to.
Things are getting better somewhat. But new situations give rise to new
difficulties. This is the life. To rise at 5 a.m. Worship 6 a.m. Fruit

23. LETTER TO GENERAL TRAFFIC MANAGER,
G. I. P. RAILWAY
[AHMEDABAD ,

June 28, 1915] 1
THE GENERAL TRAFFIC MANAGER
G. I. P. R AILWAY
BOMBAY
SIR,

I travelled on the 27th instant from Poona to Bombay on 3rd
class return ticket, taking the 16.45 train last Saturday from Kirkee.
As my ticket was only as far as Dadar and as I wished to go as far as
Victoria Terminus, I informed an official that I was travelling beyond
my destination. I attempted to give the information at Dadar but
succeeded in giving it only at Parel. The official, who I subsequently
learnt was a brakesman, told me to inform the bada 2 Guard. I could
not do so as he was in a far-off compartment. At Masjid the
authorities collected from me the fare from Dadar and the usual
penalty, notwithstanding my protest. They ascertained too from the
brakesman that I had duly informed him. The authorities at Masjid
said that in order to enable them to exempt me from the penalty, I
should produce a certificate from the Guard or the Station Master.
You will see that I could not procure the certificate without the risk of
missing the train. I asked for the certificate from the only official
whom I could safely approach. And he would not grant one. I bring
this incident to your notice as I have often observed that 3rd class
1

passengers are often punished without any fault of their own. I shall
be obliged if you will kindly inquire into this matter. In my opinion,
either Station Masters should be instructed not to charge penalties
when information has been given about over-travelling to any railway
official of the company or strict instructions should be given as to
promp issue of certificates by the officials concerned. If it was not
competent for the brakesman to issue the certificate, was it not his
duty to immediately inform the Guard that a passenger
wasover-travelling and that he had applied for the usual certificate?
I enclose herewith the receipt for this fare and the penalty.1
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant

24. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
AHMEDABAD ,

July 2 [1915] 2
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Your letters are getting provokingly brief week after week. Do
not give me up like that. You fret that I do not write at length. But
imagine a person travelling almost continuously in a crowded 3rdclass compartment and being besieged by visitors immediately on
landing. What is one to say in such circumstances? I did not during
my travels get a moment to myself. And now too it is continuous
work. But I can now attend to some of my correspondence.
Dr. Mehta asks me whether I am going to try for your entry
here. It is an impossibility. Things are becoming stricter and there
seems to be no way out of the difficulty. At the same time I am going
to make a desperate effort when I meet the Viceroy in the natural
course.
1

In his reply dated July 18, the Acting Deputy Traffic Manager (Commercial)
said: “From enquiries made, I find that you did not intimate at Dadar your intention to
ride on to V. Terminus, and since you had already ridden as far as Parel before any
intimation was given to the train staff, you were correctly encessed, and I cannot
grant you any relief.”

The medal has worried me. It was announced without consultation. To refuse a medal would have been churlish. I therefore said
nothing about it. I wrote a note to the Viceroy when at length a formal
letter conferring the medal came to me. It is not considered the same
as a title. It was presented last week1 at a Government at-home.
Mrs. Gandhi is lying in bed causing some anxiety. She is under
the treatment of an Indian physician2 . She has lost faith in my
treatment. She has become a most difficult patient.
I am receiving much critism on the scheme. I may some day be
able to send you copies of some of it. Here as you may imagine, I
have no copying assistance.
I am myself keeping fairly well. Somehow or other I cannot
regain my original vigour.
My food just now is only nuts and dried figs or dates and

AHMEDABAD ,

July 9 [1915] 1
MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have your letter. I must say I feel nothing about your being
interned. It was to come. You have a rare opportunity for disciplining
yourself and of affecting your neighbours. You will have plenty of
time to think. This prolongation may mean more prolonged separation between us. But we shall learn to live together more intimately
even though we may be separated bodily. In thousand and one things
I miss you. In some experiences I feel glad you are not with me. In
fullness of time, when we meet, we shall [have] grown, let us hope,
better and better able to reach our common goal.
The life here has become most regular and nobody has leisure
for idle talk. Boys who wanted to have their ambition fulfilled, I do
not encroach upon their time for study. They appreciate this very
much.
My diet just now consists of soaked figs, monkey-nuts and
lemons. This is a somewhat trying place for cheap fruit. Those who
were saltless remain so here also and some now and then become
fruitarians for a week or so.
All are learning Hindi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Gujarati and Arithmetic.
They have 4 hours of study, apart from their morning study.
How about your cabinet-making? This ought not to be
interrupted. But I shall know more from week to week.

27. SPEECH AT BOMBAY PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE,
POONA1
July 11, 1915
MR. PRESIDENT, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

Perhaps, it is impudent on my part to add anything to the
feeling words that have been spoken by Mrs. Ranade. The fact that
she is the widow of the master’s master adds solemnity to the
proceedings, which I can only mar by any remarks I may make. But,
claiming as I do to be one of Mr. Gokhale’s disciples, you will forgive
me if I say a few words which are personal titbits.
It was on board the Cronprinz some years ago,2 that I found
myself in the master’s company together with a common friend, Mr.
Kallenbach3 , a German. Let me say that all Germans are not fiends,
nor; are all German soldiers Friend.4 Mr. Kallenbach is a German and
a soldier, but I feel that no purer-minded person to-day walks the
earth in Europe than Mr. Kallenbach. He was accepted as a worthy
companion by Mr. Gokhale, who used to play with him the game of
quoits. Mr. Gokhale had just then, during the voyage from England to
Cape Town, picked up that g ame, and he very nearly gave Mr.
Kallenbach a beating in the game. I fancy that was a drawn game
between them, and, let me add, Mr. Kallenbach, so far as I am aware, is
one of the cleverest players of quoits in South Africa. Just after that
we had our meals at which Mr. Gokhale was talking to me with
reference to the result of the game. He thought I never indulged in
such sports and that I was against them. He expostulated with me in
kind words and said, “Do you know why I want to enter into such
competition with Europeans? I certainly want to do at least as much as
1
While seconding the following resolution moved by Mrs. Ramabai Ranade:
“The Conference places on record its sense of, profound grief at the irreparable loss
the country and the Empire have sustained in the untimely and the universally
mourned death of the late Mr. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, than whom no more
self-sacrificing and devoted patriot and no more far-sighted statesman ever
consecrated his life in the cause of his country.”

they can do for the sake of our country. It is said, rightly or wrongly,
that we are an inferior people in many matters, and so far as I can do
it”—and this he said in all humility—“I certainly want to show that
we are at least their equals, if not their superiors.”
That was one incident. On board the same steamer, we were
engaged in a hot discussion in connection with. our dear motherland,
and he was mapping out for me, as a father would for his child, a
programme that I was to follow in India if I ever happened to see the
motherland again, and, in connection therewith, there was one thing he
said: “We lack in India character; we want religious zeal in the
political field.” Shall we then follow the spirit of the master with the
same thoroughness and the same religious zeal, so that we can safely
teach a child politics? One of his missions in life, I think, was to
inculcate the lesson that whatever we do, we should do with
thoroughness. This it is not possible for us mortals to imitate in any
degree of perfection. Whatever he did, he did with a religious zeal;
that was the secret of his success. He did not wear his religion on his
sleeve; he lived it. Whatever he touched, he purified; wherever he went,
he recreated an atmosphere around him which was fragrant. When he
came to South Africa, he electrified the people there not only by his
magnificent eloquence but by the sincerity of his character and by the
religious devotion with which he worked. What was that devotion?
Ailing though he was, he was awake the whole night practically when
he was to have seen General Smuts; he did so in order to prepare the
case for his countrymen with a thoroughness that surprised the leader
of the Boer Government. What was the result? The result was that he
got the promise from the South African Government that the £3 tax
would be gone in a few years, and the £3 tax is no more. It is no more
there to grind down so many thousands of our countrymen. Mr.
Gokhale is dead, but it is possible for you and for me to make his
spirit live in us and through us. (“Hear, hear.”) We are about to pass
resolutions which would expect us, the chosen representatives, or, it
may be, the self-elected representatives of the people to do certain
things. Shall we discharge our trust with the master’s devotion? The
people we represent will base their verdict not upon our speeches but
upon our actions, and how shall we act? We have a right to pass this
resolution if we act in the spirit of the master. With these words, I have
much pleasure in seconding this resolution.

31. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
AHMEDABAD ,

July 16 [1915]
MY DEAR FRIEND,

There is no letter from you for this week.
There is a pencil letter from you complaining of want of news
from me. Events have moved with me so swiftly that I did not know
what to say and what to omit. Names of men and places I omitted as I
could not give you the history of men and geography of places I
visited. Bolpur I left as it never was the intention to settle down there.
The boys’ services were required in the nursing department at a fair in
a holy place and they left. They then went to Gurukul whilst I was
touring through Madras. After finishing Madras I took up quarters at
Ahmedabad and sent for the company. At Madras the two friends who

However I feel that it is the right thing. There is something
noble in a 7-year-old lad thinking he is working for his meal and he is
studying for his country. There is something great if a boy of seven
does not look forward to leaving the place when he is learning and
altering his life. After a number of years whether many will do this or
not is not the question. What is of importance is that some are making
a serious attempt to live such a life. There was a verse we read at the
morning prayer today. ‘Pain and pleasure, happiness and misery are
without doubt results of some previous causes set in motion by
ourselves.’ This thought gives us the faculty for bearing pains without
fear or anxiety. If we add to this the thought that what passes as a
misery may not be misery at all but divine discipline.1 If a man about
to commit a heinous crime is prevented by snake-bite from fulfilling
his purpose, the bite was surely a blessing for him. Our analysis of
events is often faulty. The remedy therefore lies in trying to remain
unaffected by outward circumstances.

I got your letter. After returning from Poona, I was about to write
to you when I got yours. I am fully convinced that it will be for
Narandas’s good in every way if he joins me. And he wishes so, too. I
do think that he will not get anywhere else the opportunities he will
get here of building up his character. The others agree to his joining.
You need not at all fear that Narandas and others may have to starve
here. As for your needs, you may depend upon their being met with

has been my experience on numerous occasions that any work
embarked upon in a spirit of selflessness succeeds under all
circumstances. It may not happen in our lifetime, but l believe that the
step you have taken will greatly benefit the family in future. Whether
or not it does, will depend upon the character of the four brothers 1
and upon how long they live. I have no doubt on either point. The
four brothers complement one another. I believe I will not be
disappointed in my faith in Jamnadas. The other two, I have trained
with the hardest tasks and Narandas has given me the impression of
being quite mature in his character. With God’s grace, the country will
see what the four brothers can do.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have your letter, also the cable sent by Mr. Turner to whom I
am writing. I do not know that you expected any cable in reply.
My heart is with you. I have unpacked our goods and as a
perpetual reminder I am using your favourite wooden pillow which
you will recall you did not want to leave behind. In trying to reduce
things to order, I ever think of you, I ever miss you. As it is, I am
simply preparing the house as if I wanted to receive you. That is, you
are positively with me when I am cleaning up the compound and the
closets. I ask myself whether you would approve of my work and the
method of cleaning. Your suggestions and your nose I miss so much.
But for better or for worse we must live for some time in
physical separation. Only we must so act that we should be nearer in
spirit if we have to put up with this enforced physical separation. Your

be nearer than you were.
Your life there must be a model for the others. How I would
love to think that you are there vindicating your German birth, your
ancestral faith and our joint ideals. You vindicate the first two if you
realize the third. And i know you will not fail.
I shall expect from you a full description of the life there.
I hope you will allow anything there to irritate you and that you
will act with the greatest calmness of mind and sufficient detachment.
Life here is growing sweeter I think. It is difficult but worth
trying. More and more order is being evolved. Narandas, Maganlal’s
brother, is also coming to us. That means that all the boys of this
particular cousin of mine are to devote themselves to this kind of life.
It is wonderful sacrifice. Narandas you will love when you see him.
There is something so good about all the Chhaganlal brothers. My
brother’s boys and their wives have disappointed me completely and
so has my sister1 . This is strange. And yet not quite so strange. Harilal
is more and more going away from me. What was before hard for him
to follow is now not even worth following. He has come to the
conclusion that there is nothing good in the institution. Such is the
might of inertia.
I have unpacked all your books. They are somewhat damaged. I
shall take care of what has been spared.
Yours,

BHAISHRI CHHOTALAL,

I got your letter, but could not attend to it for want of time.
Please forgive me.
The cause of your hardship is not the Customs Department. It
originated with the Police Department. It is possible to file a suit
against the police, but I don’t advise that. I think it will be better, for
the present, to write to the Police Department. It will be advisable to
have this done through some lawyer friend of yours there. You can
also do it yourself. If you make a brief, factual statement in Gujarati,
that will serve your purpose all right. That will be the basis.
It is necessary to leave the papers about Viramgam with me for
the time being. I don’t propose to drop the matter.

Ashadh Sud 15, July 26, 1915
. . . The subject of physical contact [whether it is rightly
prohibited] is a large one. I think we are committing a great sin in
treating a whole class of people as untouchables and it is owing to the
existence of this class that we have still some revolting practices
among us. Not to eat in company with a particular person and not to
touch him are two very different things. No one is an untouchable
now. If we don’t mind contact with a Christian or a Muslim, why
should we mind it with one belonging to our own religion? No
defence of untouchability is possible now, either from the point of
view of justice or that of practical common sense.

my name in connection with the interviews I had with you. I have not
even read the things you are referring to. The conversations between
us were private and must remain so. The draft sent by you hardly does

or with its authority. I simply came as a friend and admirer and for
friends. I did not know what view the Congress party would take. I
simply put a tentative proposal before you.
I hope you will respect my wish not to be drawn in a newspaper

open to receive more Passive Resisters than there at present. Of course
you will not expend this amount if it is not required.
Allocation of £3,000 to Phoenix settlement includes assistance to
Indian Opinion. This enables you to report cases of hardship and to
help such cases also. You may even open a branch office in Durban
and collect information about hard cases of immigrants and give them
free help, you can engage men for reporting cases, etc. The expense
will be justified only as far as you use the paper to attend [to] local
relief. Allocation to passive resistance relief means relief given both
here and there. I am supporting the widows, etc., you have there your
cases in Phoenix and elsewhere. I have made a rough calculation.
For Valliama Hall up to £4,000 may be expended.
It is possible that there will be some talk about the Phoenix
allocations. But I could not do otherwise than to deal with the whole
matter as I have done. Your work if it is fruitful of results will silence
cold criticism in the end. If there is any further information please let
me know. I am having this letter copied so that I should know the
contents if you referred to it in your correspondence.

I am glad you have received all the things in good order. Have
you been using the sticks? Have the biscuits kept all right? If they
have, I must send you more biscuits and sticks.
Chhaganlal has been here for some time. He is going today to
his parents again. He has not yet decided how he will act in India. He
does not feel like joining me. Jamnadas too has gone back to Rajkot.
His is a pathetic case. He is most undecided. I can weave Indian tape.
The mechanical arrangement is very simple. Here it is.2
It represents a bunch of strings that receives the warp. A wooden
knife serves to press the woof home. A bobbin made of reed unwinds
the woof. The tape is from half an inch to two inches in width. Boys
are also put on to that work. Presently I shall go to more difficult
work.

AHMEDABAD ,

September 23 [1915] 1
DEAR MR. SHASTRIAR,

When I took in Naiker, Mrs. Gandhi did not ‘kick’. Now I had
to decide whether I was to take in a grown-up Gujarati Dhed2 with
his wife.3 I decided to take him and she rebelled against it and so
did another lady at the Ashram. There was quite a flutter in the
Ashram. There is a flutter even in Ahmedabad. I have told Mrs.
Gandhi she could leave me and we should part good friends. The step
is momentous because it so links me with the suppressed classes
mission that I might have at no distant time to carry out the idea of
shifting to some Dhed quarters and sharing their life with the Dheds.
It would mean much even for my staunchest co-workers. I have now
given you the outline of the story. There is nothing grand about it. It
is of importance to me because it enables me to demonstrate the
efficacy of passive resistance in social questions and when I take the
final step, it will embrace swaraj, etc.
Please share this with Dr. Deva and any other member you
please.

Ahmedabad and people thought of even boycotting the Ashram.

seven patients last week, all more or less in a bad state. It was no
ordinary illness. I am thankful to say they are all convalescent now.
These included Ramdas and Devdas. They were all treated after our
fashion partial or total starvation and hip-baths.
You know what a Pariah is. He is what is called an untouchable.
The widow’s son whom I have taken is a Pariah but that did not shock
Mrs. Gandhi so much. Now I have taken one from our own parts and
Mrs.Gandhi as also Maganlal’s wife were up in arms against me. They
made my life miserable so far as they could. I told them they were not
bound to stay with me. This irritated them the more. The storm has
not yet subsided. I am however unmoved and comparatively calm.
The step I have taken means a great deal. It may alter my life a bit,
i.e., I may have to completely take up Pariah work, i.e., I might have
to become a Pariah myself. We shall see. Anyway let my troubles
brace you up if they can.
Andrews and Pearson were with me for a day. I lent the latter
some of your books. They are both on their way to Fiji in order to
investigate the indenture question.
Harilal was here for a few days. He is gone. His wife is here with
her children.
I am sending you a piece of cloth from what has been woven by
us. It is Manilal’s work. Sewing is mine and Devdas’s. May it serve to
wipe your hand and may the spirit that has prompted the gift serve to
strengthen the inner man in you.
With love,
Yours,

57. LETTER TO KHUSHALCHAND GANDHI
AHMEDABAD ,

Bhadarva Vad 1, September 24, 1915
RESPECTED KHUSHALBHAI,

I realized after meeting Narandas that you repent having given
him the permission and the chief cause for remorse is that I have
admitted a learned dhea 1 [to the ashram] . That would have hurt the
feelings of Santok too. In fact, no one should feel bad about it
because in Phoenix we shared food with everyone. But the same thing
is viewed differently here.
There is no need for you to feel sorry. Narandas has taken a
very good step. If I was not worried about the unhappiness of my
sister-in-law, I would have boldly asked Narandas to come here.
However, on considering everything, I thought it was better for
Narandas to go to Madras with his wife. There Tamil....2 Santok and
the two girls are going.
Maganlal is accompanying them to Bombay today.
By doing so, Narandas, Jamna, Santok and the girls would not
be caught in the storm3 that threatens the Ashram. They would not be
banished from the caste and so their sorrow will be a little less.
Jamnadas is no doubt there. There is no need for him to come here.
It is Chhaganlal’s duty to stay on in Phoenix. Now remain
Maganlal and his children. Let him be caught in the storm along with
me. Those who live with me, should never expect that they will never
have external problems because those who live with me should learn
to welcome problems and realize that purification lies in that. I have
told Maganlal that he should go to Madras for a short period if he
wanted to. There is no objection if Maganlal goes to Madras and
Narandas comes here. I have asked the two brothers to do what is
convenient to them.
I am going to fulfil your desire once Narandas is relieved from
his job.

CHI. MAGANLAL,

I have again written2 to respected Khushalbhai. You should
handle the situation there quite calmly. Do what will please the self. If
Santok wants to return, let her. It will be all right even if she goes to
Madras. She need only observe all the Ashram rules there. If you
want, you may stay on there [for some time] or go to Madras.
There have been two letters for you, which, for the present, I
don’t send on.
Narandas should remain determined. He should be confident
and fearless about the future.
Keshu came round very soon. Already, he is playing about
today. Two of his different groups [of subjects] are under my charge.
I am therefore in a better position to observe how he does.
Purushottam3 has felt nothing. He had his usual meal.
Dudabhai will arrive on Sunday morning.
Things have been happening at Phoenix, it seems.4 Chhaganlal
appears to have cut off his connection altogether. The price of Indian
Opinion has been reduced to one penny. It seems he has been hasty.
This also must be for a good end. More when you are here. You, of

59. LETTER TO A. H. WEST
AHMEDABAD ,

September 26 [1915] 1
MY DEAR WEST,

I have your typewritten letter.
I note the changes made and I accept them. The central idea is
that Indian Opinion should be kept up at any cost. If you can be
totally independent of public support, i.e., from the Passive Resistance
Fund, so much the better.
This means revision of the account sent to you by me. 2
Fortunately there was delay on my side. The new scheme requires a
revision which I shall do shortly.
I am not going to keep the large sum with me but it will be
handed over to the Trust.
As for part of the payment to Pragji 3 and Imam Saheb 4 being,
debited to the P. R. Fund, I am inclined to think that they were present
at the meeting, where the matter was settled. But if they object, the
amounts could be debited to the P. R. Fund as assistance to Indian
Opinion. In either case, the money has to come from the P. R. Fund.
It was debited by way of relief as the whole amount could not be a
legitimate charge against Indian Opinion. But for their being
passiveresisters, we could not have availed ourselves of their services.
But it was a matter of account keeping. I should be prepared to
defend the outlay in any case.

Indian Opinion is a bad sign. However I must not grumble. You who
are on the spot must know what is best. The ideals we are working are
common to us and you will work according to your own way. Hence
the Phoenix Trust. I can only advise from this distance.
Auditing, if it is to cost anything appreciable, is useless. Our
books contain all the transactions. The bank-balance represents the
savings from the Fund, etc. However, even in this matter you know
best what should be done.
Mr. Rustomjee’s warning is now superfluous as I shall not be
handling the funds any more. For the Phoenix funds there are the
trustees and they may, subject to the sanction of the schemers, do the
needful.
This exhaust the points raised by you. The amount fixed for
Polak should stand until he himself feels that he can dispense with it.

No letter from you after your transference. Mr. Turner has

The admission of a Pariah family continues to occupy me. I
have been deserted by most helpers and the burden is all falling on
my shoulder assisted by two or three who are remaining staunch. Poor
Maganlal is simply torn asunder. He is in Bombay fixing up with his
wife and mother. How it is a question whether Narandas will come. I
have told you that a time may come when I may irresistibly take a step
which may result in my being left alone. Well, I must still follow the
light as I find it.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I hope you have received my letter the one that did not reach
you in time. There was no omission [on] my side. We are all so shorthanded that I do not like to ask anyone to write to you.
Here there is no extensive piece of ground for cultivation hardly
one acre. There are two roomy houses with little plots of ground
attached. We are doing only a little vegetable gardening. Water is
drawn from two wells. These are rustic wells, with primitive
contrivances for drawing water. The dispute was paltry, out of
cussedness. The man felt polluted because the boys fetched water
from his side of the well. It was no water dispute.
We are now weaving our own cloth, sewing things, too, ourselves.
The buildings were ready for our occupation. They are hired
houses. We are not on our own ground yet. Manilal has completed his
weaving lessons. He has now gone to a village to complete his course.
Maganlal too has nearly picked it up. Devdas is becoming an expert
tailor. He is turning out a fine student.
But the life here owing to the untouchable problem has become
most difficult for me. Mrs. Gandhi is the cause. And yet as I have told
you I am internally at peace.
Now good-bye.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have your letter. Mrs. Gandhi has become a little better but
before she could regain her sanity I had to undertake partial
starvation. I lived without nuts for a few days.
Just now we have about 40 guests. Of these 37 are from an
institution about 150 miles from here. So we have been obliged for
the last 4 days to cook for about 80 people. Fortunately there are
some fine workers and the guests themselves do their share of the
work. They assist in the kitchen, in water-carrying and grinding.
Carpentry is going strong. We are making sectional book-cases.
I think I mentioned this to you. Your books will be housed in one of
them. When you see these you will like them. There will be five
sections to each. The cost will come to about £6 each. Cheap enough
you will say. But according to the measure here £6 for a book-case is
rather a heavy charge.
I wish I could give you a sketch of the handlooms but I cannot.
It is an intricate affair. You cannot have any notion from my
description because I cannot give you a technical description. Suffice
it to say that it has as much string-work as wood-work. The cost of the
simplest loom is under £7.
Maganlal is to leave for Madras in a day or two in order to
finish his Tamil study and his handloom experience. There is a big
and rather good handloom business in Madras.
Did I tell you that we all remain in the house bare-bodied? All
we wear is dhotar the cloth round the waist. It is the sanest thing we
could have done. I receive visitors, both English and Indian, in that
condition. So you will see that the cost of clothing will be very little.
We shall confine ourselves to our own production.
And now good-bye. The bell has gone to serve the boys. Do
come soon and take your share in the serving.
Yours always,

64 . SPEECH ON INDENTURED INDIAN LABOUR AT
BOMBAY1
October 28, 1915
Mr. Gandhi, who was loudly cheered by the audience, said that the question of
indentured labour was just now a topical question, because those true and real friends
of India, Messrs Andrews and Pearson, were conducting an enquiry2 in Fiji. The Fiji
Islands absorbed the largest number of indentured Indians at the present moment.
Messrs Andrews and Pearson were not the first to interest the Indians in this question,
but it was the deceased statesman, Mr. Gokhale, who first impressed Indians with the
importance of their duties in connection with this question. Mr. Gandhi here read the
resolution 3 introduced by Mr. Gokhale in the Viceregal Council and his speech4 upon
it demanding the total abolition of the indenture system and commented upon it at
some length. The resolution which Mr. Gokhale brought before the Council was
defeated by a majority, though all5 the non-official members of the Council voted for
the abolition. However much a benign and sympathetic Viceroy wished to remove
this abominable system of indenture from the Indian Statute Book, there was a very
serious difficulty in his way and that was the report by the two Commissioners, who
were sent by Lord Hardinge, namely, Messrs MacNeill and Chimanlal,6 which was
contained in two bulky volumes. All might not care to wade through the rather dull
pages of those volumes, but to him who knew what real indentured labour was they
were of great interest. They might, however, take upon trust that the report
recognised that indentured labour should continue just as it was, if certain conditions
were fulfilled. Those conditions, Mr. Gandhi said, were impossible of fulfilment. And
the recommendations, which these two great Commissioners made, showed that they
really could not seriously have meant that the system of indenture which existed
today in Fiji, Jamaica, Guiana and other colonies should be continued a minute longer
than was actually necessary. The speaker here referred to the previous commission
and said that the defects which Messrs MacNeill and Chimanlal had pointed out were
patent to all. Their report contained nothing new. But there was unofficial
investigation on behalf of some philanthropic body in England some forty years

ago, and in that book an unvarnished tale was given, which told in graphic language
what were the hardships under the system.
In this connection, Mr. Gandhi quoted a statement made by the Prime Minister
of Natal in which he said that the system of indenture was a most inadvisable thing
and that the sooner it was terminated, the better for the indentured labourer and the
employer. Lord Selborne said the same thing when he was the High Commissioner in
South Africa: he said that it was worse for the employer than the employed, because it
was a system perilously near to slavery. Sir William Hunter1 wrote a beautiful series
of letters in 1895 when he first brought himself to study the system personally and
compared the system of indenture, after due investigation, to a state bordering on
slavery. On one occasion he used the expression ‘semi-slavery’. Mr. Gandhi said if he
erred in making these statements, he erred in Lord Selborne’s company. And it was in
connection with this system that these two worthy gentlemen, the Commissioners,
had seen fit to report and advise the fulfilment of certain conditions which in the very
nature of the contract were impossible of fulfilment. The conditions were that
unsuitable emigrants be excluded; the proportion of females to males to be raised
from 40 to 50 per cent. The speaker could not understand what they meant by
“unsuitable emigrants” being excluded. The Commissioners themselves told them
that it was not easy to find labour in India. India was not pining to send her children
out as semi-slaves. Lord Sanderson2 stated that it was the surplus population from
India that went out from dissatisfaction with the economic condition in India. But
they must remember that there were 500 recruiting licences issued in the year 1907.
Could they conceive the significance of the extraordinary state of things which
required one recruiter to 17 labourers? The Colonial Governments had their sub-agents
in India for this indentured labour to be collected. They were paid a sum of Rs. 25 for
each cooly recruited, and this sum of Rs. 25 was divided between the recruiter and the
sub-agent. Mr. Gandhi thought the mental state of those recruiters must be miserable,
who could send so many of their countrymen as semi-slaves. After having seen what
the recruiting agents did and after having read the many gross mis-statements they
made, he was not surprised that thousands and thousands of their countrymen were
becoming indentured labourers. The Commissioners devoted several pages to the
immorality prevailing on the estates. It was not forty women for sixty men, but the
statement was made that these men did not marry these women, but kept them and that

many of these women were prostitutes. Mr. Gandhi said he would decline to send his
children out of the country under such an indenture, if he was worthy of his salt. But
thousands of men and women had gone. What did they think of that in India?
The conditions were that rigorous provisions should be either expunged from
the Ordinances and that the Protector should control employers. As for the
regulations made to protect these labourers, they could take it from him, Mr. Gandhi
said, that there were a great many flaws in them and a coach and four could be easily
driven through these. The aim of the rules was to make the employer supreme. Here
was capital ranged against labour with artificial prop for capital and not labour.
Mr. Gandhi condemned the “protectors” of emigrants. They were men
belonging to that very class to which employers belonged; they moved among them
and was it not only natural that they should have their sympathies on the side of the
employers? How was it then possible that they could do justice to the labourer against
the employer? He knew many instances when magistrates had meted out justice to the
indentured labourer, but it was impossible to expect such a thing from the Protectors
of Emigrants. The labourer was bound hand and foot to the employer. If he committed
an offence against his employer, he first of all had to undergo a course of
imprisonment; then the days that the labourer had spent in the jail were added to his
indenture and he was taken back to his master to serve again. The Commissioners had
nothing to say against these rules. There was nobody to judge the Protector of
Emigrants if he gave a wrong judgment, but in the case of the magistrate he could be
criticised. Again, the Commissioners said that these prisoners should be put into
separate jails. But the Colonial Government would be bankrupt if they built jails for
hundreds of prisoners that were imprisoned. They were not able to build jails for the
passive resisters. Then the Commissioners said that the labourer should be allowed to
redeem his indenture by payment of a graduated redemption fee. They made a mistake
in thinking him to be an independent man. He was not his own master. Mr. Gandhi
said he had known of English girls, well educated, who were decoyed, and who were
not indentured, unable to free themselves. How was it then possible for an indentured
labourer to do this? Then the Commissioners said the special needs of Indian children
in the matter of primary education should receive consideration. As for education, Mr.
Gandhi said, no doubt, some work of that kind was being done by some of the
philanthropic missions, but nothing substantial was being done or could be
expected. Mr. Balfour1 compared the labourer under an indenture to a soldier. But the
soldier was a responsible man and he could rise to a high position. But an indentured
labourer remained a labourer. He had no privileges. His wife was also included under
his disabilities, so also his son. In Natal the finger of scorn was pointed at these

people. Never could an indentured Indian rise to a higher post than that of labourer.
And what did the labourer bring when he returned to India? He returned a broken
vessel, with some of the artificial and superficial signs of civilization, but he left
more valuable things behind him. He might bring some sovereigns also with him.
They should decline to perpetuate this hateful system of indenture because it robbed
them of their national self-respect.
If they could consider well over what he had said, they would try and abolish
the system in a year’s time and this one taint upon the nation would have gone and
indentured labour would be a thing of the past. He wanted to remove thecause of the
ill-treatment of Indians in the Colonies. However protected that system might be, it
still remained a state bordering upon slavery. It would remain, said Mr. Gandhi, a
state based upon full-fledged slavery and it was a hindrance to national growth and
national dignity.

67. LETTER TO A. H. WEST
AHMEDABAD ,

October 31 [1915] 1
MY DEAR WEST,

I have your indictment. If you do not speak out, who would? I
value your friendship just because you always say exactly what you
mean.
Now for the reply.
I could not consult anyone there as to allocations because I was
not there. The Phoenix allocations were discussed between us there.
Relief allocations needed no discussion. Valiama Hall allocation was
settled there. The £1,000 for Polak’s expenses, should he have to
return to England penniless, was a matter which was fixed there but I
am not able to say that it was positively discussed. But I suggest that it
is again an expense about which I should not deem consultation
necessary. If the community has any respect for itself, it could not
send them away starving. It would be pure passive resistance relief. I
would not dream about publishing it in the accounts sheet. We are not
bound to disclose the names of the resisters helped.
Mr. Petit’s statement was published after consultation with me.
Mine was delayed at his instance. I have brought every item; including
Polak’s £1,000 to the Committee’s notice. I am even going to bring to
Mr. Petit’s notice your and Rustomji’s dissent.
You suggest that you could not take interest which is tainted nor
would you take the help offered. I congratulate you. The strongeryou
are, the better. The allocations suggested by me were due to our
collective weakness. But you will not find me weakening you if you

are strong.
You suggest that for Phoenix’s improvement, I would have to
send you money from elsewhere. This I could not do. Even when we
discussed there, it was clearly understood that the charges should
come out of the passive resistance funds, as we were running Phoenix
as a P. R. farm and wanted to make it more and more a refuge for
indentured Indians who may be in distress. If therefore you want the
help, it can only come out of the fund.
I would certainly welcome any decision you may come to as to
not receiving any help.
The money does not belong to South Africa. The Committee
here has control over it. They asked that the funds be transferred to
them, subject to such allocations as I may suggest. I am now having
no definite allocations but shall receive monies for you in S.A. as you
there may desire from time to time. This gives the Committee here the
fullest control. I shall act as the go between.
As to books, you are quite wrong. Our books contain all the
receipts and all disbursements. We need no audit, we owe nobody
anything and no one has a legal right to ask us to do anything except
the Committee. Individual subscribers may ask. Them we could
satisfy. Not a penny has been yet spent which could not be brought
within the scope of the fund.
Relief to resisters includes Polak, Thambi and even Mr.
Cachalia. I do not think we have received the loan given to him. So
will it include Chhaganlal, Maganlal, Pragji, etc. It will most decidedly
include Naidoo’s and other passive resisters’ children. It will not
include me and my family simply because our expenses are found
otherwise. As I am or rather have been the controller of the funds, I
have desired to remain free from personal help. But if I had no one
else to help me, I should not hesitate to draw for self and children.
Only then I would at least make that clear to the public. No such
precaution is necessary regarding other passive resisters as I cover
them.
I need not discuss your proposal to invest in land, as we no
longer have the funds under our control.
I have cabled1 you regarding Chhaganlal. He seems to be
breaking up. If so, he should be sent here. And unless Pragji and

I know is this that you must continue I.O. even if you have to labour
in the streets and if you burn your boats, so much the better. If you
cannot, you and your family, so long as you are at Phoenix turning
out the paper, will be supported at all costs.
I think I have now exhausted all the material points raised by
you. I mean material in view of the new state of things. Now you may
all consider and let me know your decision. I have P. R. a/c to 31st

me have further a/c.

CHI. MAGANLAL,

I sent a cable2 to say that Chi. Chhaganlal might be sent here if
he was still ill. Khushalbhai was very pleased. The reply came
“Chhaganlal better, West.” I can see from this that he is not likely to
come in the near future. I am writing all the same that, if they can
spare Chhaganlal, he may come away.
The printing of the satyagraha account is nearly over.
Keshu is enjoying himself. He had slight fever for a day. All the
children sleep by my side. I take their lessons and that is a great
advantage. I take all the lessons of Naransami and Parthasarathi with
the exception of Sanskrit, and I intend to continue doing so for the
present.
Ba has calmed down a little. But I observe she is smouldering
inside. About untouchability she has relaxed a little.

AHMEDABAD ,

November 5, 1915
MY DEAR WEST,

I forgot to mention that Valiama Hall had to go. I saw that the
Committee2 do not like the idea. It would have sanctioned it if I had
insisted, but I did not especially in view of the condition of the
community there.
I have your wire about Chhaganlal. 3 Letters recently received
from Chhaganlal have been alarming. And I felt that if he was not
keeping well, it was better to send him here. The latest from him says
that even if he was well, he could not only be spared but that his
retirement would cause relief. If he can be spared, he may be sent.
If you need [an] assistant from here, I would send after 3
months or thereabout.
I cabled4 too saying that audit was unnecessary. You could gain
nothing by auditing especially now. If we decide not to take any
public funds, our books can be only simple. All you will then have
will be receipts from Indian Opinion and book sales and expenditure.
What is left for Polak is earmarked. If you would not handle it there, it
now could be transferred here. But I hope that you will all consider
that allotment to be necessary.
Valiama Hall ground may be kept or it may be sold and the
proceeds returned here.
Maganlal has gone to Madras to finish his Tamil studies. His
wife accompanies him and also Fakiri Naidoo.
Yours sincerely,

As you address the letters in Gujarati, they go to the Dead Letter
Office before they arrive here. If the name of the town is written in

Dr. Deva 2 is here at present. He got your letter very late. He was
touring. He asks you now to reply to Nogin Babu that he may go
whenever he wants to, after giving eight days’ notice. Accommodation
will be arranged by Dr. Deva. Does Manilal experience any difficulty
in starching the yarn?
There is no new work on hand at present. Prabhudas3 has left off
carpentry. I set him to work on the loom for as many hours as
possible. Hajee Ismail Moosa is also here. A meeting was held this
evening to honour Dr. Deva. There was a good attendance. I hope
you are going on with your Tamil. I don’t think it is necessary to ask
for a scholarship for you from the Doctor 4 . Jamnadas is not to come
over here for the present. Did I send you a copy of [my] letter 5 to

73. SPEECH AT PHEROZESHAH MEHTA CONDOLENCE
MEETING AT AHMEDABAD1
November 15, 1915
The entrusting of this resolution to me has given me a welcome
opportunity to express my sentiments about Sir Pherozeshah in
public. He was the lion of the Bombay Municipal Corporation and I
too have sometimes heard the roaring of this lion. Many were the
battles he fought with Sir George Clarke 2 , Lord Harris 3 , successive
Viceroys and many Governors in India. No wonder that the whole of
India mourns the death of such a valiant leader. But there is
selfishness behind this expression of grief. If many more among us
could live and die as he lived and died we would in that case have
nothing to grieve for. A little while ago, India was lamenting the death
of the Hon’ble Mr. Gokhale. Before these tears had dried, we have
had another stunning blow. It would not be fair to compare these two
great men. They did their best, each according to his lights. Mr.
Gokhale was a selfless man and as such deserved the title of rishi.
There are two epithets which describe Sir Pherozeshah. In the first
place, he was the Father of the Bombay Municipal Corporation and, in
the second, he was the uncrowned king of Bombay, say rather, of the
whole of India—a king chosen by the subjects themselves. He took
the lead on every public issue and the people had come to have such
confidence in him that they would do whatever he wanted them to do.
That was because of the respect that people, not only of Bombay city
but of the whole Presidency, had for his judgment. There was none to
challenge his position in the Presidency. At a time when the people of
India expect to win important political rights, no one is left, we may
say, who could speak to the Government on our behalf. I have read
somewhere that those who love their friends dearly love them all the
more in their death; likewise, if we are overflowing with love at this
moment, it is because of the great qualities of Sir Pherozeshah. We
may have crossed him often enough when he was alive, spoken well or

ill of him; but, now that he has gone, we are not to look at his faults. It
is but our duty that we should hold a condolence meeting on his
death. We must not, however, stop with this. It was Sir Pherozeshah’s
desire that we, too, all of us, should render public service as he did and
we shall have done our duty to him only if we render such service. His
body, which was mortal, has perished but what he did will live on. His
interest in public service was so keen that he would get his clients’
cases adjourned or let go his fees, suffer all manner of inconvenience
even to attend meetings of the Bombay Municipal Corporation. He
would sometimes not go to the Assembly; he considered the work of
the Corporation of greater importance. He did not like being
absorbed exclusively in political activities. It was his principle that
whatever one took up, one must carry to success and he, therefore,
gave his best attention to the work of the Bombay Corporation. There
is no city in India in which a member has rendered such services in
the field of municipal work as Sir Pherozeshah has done. The world
has admired the services of Mr. Chamberlain1 as President of
Birmingham Municipality, but Sir Pherozeshah did, single-handed,
work for Bombay which it would have taken four Chamberlains to do.
The right memorial to Sir Pherozeshah would be for all municipalities
to work in the manner he did. The daily political discussions in Sir
Pherozeshah’s office were unfailingly echoed immediately in the
public at large, so important and influential were his views. He was
more of an Indian than a Parsi and believed that the unity of India
could be achieved only by turning the entire population into a single
community. The discussions in his office were mainly concerned with
how we could fight fearlessly for our rights. He had to suffer much
while doing public service. He once gave me the best advice on this
subject. I was insulted by an Englishman once and I was about to file
a suit for damages against him. Sir Pherozeshah told me then that, if I
wished to do any good to myself or the country, I should swallow the
insult and that I should swallow similar insults in future as well.
Indeed, I have had to swallow them on numerous occasions. I must
admit that whatever capacity for work I possess I owe to this advice. If
we pay tributes to him today, it is because of his good sense, his
courage and faith. I feel like making a suggestion about how we may
perpetuate the memory of this great man whom Ahmedabad mourns
today. This public hall is so small that the city should be ashamed of
1

it, for towns even one-fourth the size of Ahmedabad possess halls
bigger than this. It is my submission, therefore, that the people of
Ahmedabad should build a big public hall in memory of Sir
Pherozeshah Mehta. His magnificence, too, deserves to be understood.
He was lavish in spending money. Mr. Gokhale, Mr. Ishvar Chandra
Vidyasagar1 and others held one view about how one should live and
Pherozeshah held another, which, however, did no harm. Ahmedabad
ought to put up a memorial to so great a man and I hope my appeal
will find favour with the people of Ahmedabad.

AHMEDABAD
November 21,1915
At a public meeting held at the Premabhai Hall, Ahmedabad, on November 21,
1915, to celebrate the birthday of the famous philosopher of Gujarat, Shrimad
Rajchandra1 , Gandhiji, who occupied the chair, dwelt in the course of his opening
remarks on the appropriateness of the celebration of the great philosopher’s
birthday.
Dealing with the life of Rajchandra, Mr. Gandhi mentioned that he had come in
close personal contact with him and, so far as he was competent to judge, he declared
it to be his deliberate opinion that the deceased was one of the best religious
philosophers of modern times in India. He was incomparable in true perception, he
was free from attachment, and had true vairagya in him. 2 He followed no narrow creed.
He was a universalist and had no quarrel with any religion in the world. In the West,
the speaker had found Tolstoy and Ruskin among the best philosophers and he did not
hesitate to put the deceased above both of them. The deceased outdid them in religious
experience. The faith of the deceased was a robust faith, such as could only be based
upon the true realisation of the self. Upon the speaker’s own life, the deceased had
exercised a very powerful influence. There was a suitable and certain sublimity and
genuineness about the writings of the deceased, which gave them peculiar charm and
enabled them to have a powerful hold upon the reader.
Concluding, Mr. Gandhi hoped that those who had attended the celebration
would take the trouble of studying the writings of the deceased Mahatma and he
promised that they would feel all the better for their trouble.

[Before November 26, 1915]
The Ashram activities are in full swing. It has at present 33
inmates in all, three of whom are Dheds. These latter have become a
serious issue. Ahmedabad is considered to be a stronghold of
sanatana dharma 2 . Hence the issue of the Dheds has led to a storm.
At first we thought the entire Ashram would be outcast, and that may
yet happen. The boys have made much progress in their study of
Sanskrit, Hindi and Tamil. They are being taught carpentry and
hand-weaving. Two carpenters are engaged in the Ashram. In a few
days, we shall send you some cloth woven on looms by our own
hands. The boys have made tables, etc. They are now working at
book-cases for holding books.

are both now in Fiji investigating the indenture question. Before
going, they passed some time here. They were quite happy. They are
to be back in two months’ time. Pearson is a full-fledged teacher at

attack of cholera. He was better when he left.
Maganlal was upon his trial when the Pariah was admitted. He
stood it well. He remains as much attached to the Ashram as ever. But
what I said in my letter holds good. My soul may take me anywhere
any day and I may find myself without the staunchest of my coworkers at that time. It will certainly be no fault of theirs. I cannot
expect them to understand or follow me in all my flights.
Mrs. Gandhi still remains disturbed. She does not want to live
away from me. If she could overcome the strong desire to live with
me, she would have left me long ago.
Jeki had a son born to her in Fiji. She is now in Rangoon. I have
not met her. Dr. Mehta was here the other day. He told me she was
well.
Indian Opinion has been reduced in size. The price too has
been reduced. It is 1d. now. Ritch has returned to South Africa.
This finishes the budget of news.
You say you have not influenced your surroundings, if anything
you have been influenced by them. I do not gather it from your
letters. In any event one certainly cannot be too much on one’s
guard. True worth of a man seems to me to consist in his capacity to
resist his surroundings. It is the measure of his self-realization. If we
control ourselves we cannot be controlled by others, not even by our
surroundings, not fashion, nor food, nor spectacles, nor games, nor
company, nor hobbies. There is no true happiness without this real
self rule. You have a unique opportunity of acquiring it. May it be
your lot to do so.
With love,
Yours,

78. SPEECH AT AHMEDABAD FUNCTION1
November 28, 1915
I know that you will dislike my expressing, amidst all this gaiety,
views which you will find unpleasant; I must, all the same, tell you what
I feel. It may, of course, be questioned whether, holding the views that I
do, I should have come to a gathering such as this; it is still more open
to question whether I should express them. It is love which prompted
me to come here and, again, it is love which has prompted me to stand
up and speak. You are all very happy and I too am happy to see you
honour Bhai Nanalal.
He has succeeded in gaining admission into the Indian Civil
Service. . . . 2 He deserves to be honoured for his hard work. . . 3 But
I should not like other students to follow his example and enter the
civil service. Our students do not need at present the kind of example
Civilians provide; they stand in need of the example set by the lives of
Mr. Dadabhai, Mr. Gokhale and Mr. Pherozeshah Mehta. If I may use
the words of the late Mr. Gokhale, what we need at present is
characters not labels. Bhai Nanalal’s father spent Rs. 30,000 to make
him a Civilian; I believe he could have put that money to better use
instead; and Bhai Nanalal, even if he had remained an ordinary man,
could have rendered better service to India in some other capacity, if
he had so chosen. Civilians have to come to India in plenty, and many
more will come; but it doesn’t look as if they have been particularly
useful to the country. Bhoja Bhagat4 was a cobbler but, working as a
cobbler, he succeeded in raising himself; and so also Akha Bhagat 5 ,
who was a goldsmith. Thus, if one wishes, one can progress spiritually
even while pursuing one’s vocation. And so also Bhai Nanalal could
have been more useful to the country if he had devoted himself to
its service while pursuing some vocation. You are in love with labels
and you think that it is something to have acquired one. On the
contrary, as I believe, the man is crushed beneath them, loses his truth.

We have no need at present of labels like B.A., M.A., Baronet,
K.C.S.I., C.I.E., Sir, the Hon’ble, etc. We need men who will rise
above the desire for all such honours and work. People need
education which will enable everyone to express his thoughts with the
utmost freedom. Today, all over the country there is an atmosphere of
fear, so much so that we feel afraid, unnecessarily, even to express our
views. We need an education that will blow up all such notions and
make us truly fearless. We don’t need labels. I know many of you will
not like this discordant note. But, whispering into my ear a little while
ago, Bhai Nanalal asked me why the people in India are so much
impressed by success at examinations. He said he could speak nothing
of this but asked me if I wouldn’t like to say something. It is this hint
from him which prompted me to say a few things which I had in
mind. You may accept what appeals to you and throw away or leave
behind in this hall what may seem rubbish to you. I wouldn’t mind it
either way. I wish Bhai Nanalal all success in doing his duty, that is, in
loyally serving theGovernment and comporting himself with the
people, over whom he will be placed in authority, not as their superior
but as one of them; for he should know that the people are not the
slaves of the officers, it is the officers who are their servants. May God
give Bhai Nanalal long life and may he fulfil all our dreams about his
serving the country. If he does, I should be happy. If things do not
turn out so and he goes the way others do, I wish that he then
performs prayashchita1 and, should I come to hear of it all, I too
would do prayashchita for having attended this function and
addressed it. It is not enough merely to acquire a means to a good
income; there is much else one has to do afterwards and we need at
present the character, the education and the men that will teach us how
to do this.

79. INDENTURE OR SLAVERY?1
S ATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,
AHMEDABAD ,

Girmit is a corrupt form of the English word agreement. The
term cannot be dispensed with. What it suggests, “agreement” does
not. There is no alternative word in the language. The document
under which thousands of labourers used to emigrate and still
emigrate to Natal and other countries on contract for five years is
known by the labourers and the employers as girmit. A labourer so
emigrating under girmit is a girmitio 3 . About 12,000 such indentured
labourers emigrate annually from India, mostly to the Fiji Islands near
Australia, Jamaica near South America, British Guiana, Dutch Guiana
and Trinidad.
The late Mr. Gokhale, a brave soul, held indenture to be a state
bordering on slavery; it was described in the same terms by the
famous historian, the late Sir William Wilson Hunter; the same analogy
was used by Mr. Harry Escombe, a well-known former Minister of
Natal.
Indenture is indeed a state of semi-slavery. Like the slave before
him, the indentured labourer cannot buy his freedom. A slavewas
punished for not working; so also is an indentured labourer. If he is
negligent, does not attend work for a day, if he answers back,—he will
suffer imprisonment for any one of these lapses. A slave could be sold
and handed over by one owner to another, so too the indentured
labourer can be transferred from one employer to another. The
children of a slave inherited the taint of slavery; much in the same
way, the children of an indentured labourer are subject to laws
specially passed for them. The only difference between the two states
is that while slavery ended only with life, an indentured labourer can
be free after a certain number of years. It should be noted, moreover,
that indenture came after the abolition of slavery and that indentured
labourers were recruited to take the place of slaves.
The following facts concerning indentured labourers have been

established. In the countries to which they emigrate, they receive no
moral or religious education. Most of them are unmarried. On every
ship carrying indentured labourers, there is provision for taking
women to the extent of 40 per cent. Some of these are women of ill
fame. They do not, as a rule, enter into a marriage alliance. In this
state of affairs, even if 20 per cent of the men wish to marry, they
cannot. Going to lands so far away, they get into the habit of
drinking. Women, who in India would never touch wine, are
sometimes found lying dead-drunk on the roads.
After all this degradation, the profit which they point to is that
the economic condition of these people improves. Everyone will
admit that even though we may stand to gain economically by selling
our souls, we ought not to do so.
How is it that this thing has been allowed to go on for fifty years
now? None of us will be prepared to submit himself to a condition
such as this. How then did we tolerate it for our own brethren? In
raising this question, I have not the least desire to make people feel
sorry for the past, but the question helps us to realize our duty in the
present. The late Mr. Gokhale introduced, in March 1912, a resolution
in the Imperial Legislative Council, asking for the repeal of the law
governing indenture and demanding that the emigration of
indentured labourers from India be stopped. At that time, 22 members
took a pledge that “they would bring forward the resolution every
year till indenture was abolished”. It is for us, the survivors, to fulfil
that pledge. Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pearson have gone to Fiji for this
very purpose. It is not too much to say, therefore, that every educated
Indian is in duty bound to apply his mind to this question and join in
discussing it so as to help in getting it finally settled.
This is not the place to go into details; for those, however, who
wish to study the subject, there is literature in plenty and easily
accessible: in particular, the debates in the Imperial Legislative
Council on the resolution mentioned above, the Lord Sanderson
Committee Report and the report of Messrs MacNeill and Chimanlal
on the condition of indentured labourers. If any paper gets a special
note prepared on this literature, it is bound to prove useful.

80. SPEECH AT VIRAMGAM
December 1, 1915
Mohanlal [sic] Karamchand Gandhi arrived at Viramgaon on the 1st instant by
the 1 Down Mail from Ahmedabad. He was received on the station by about 25 men of
Viramgaon. After about an hour’s halt, Gandhi went on to Rajkot by train.During the
time he was on the station at Viramgaon, he made a brief speech to the assembled
people, explaining that he was going to Rajkot to collect subscriptions for a
memorial to the late Mr. Gokhale. He requested the people of Viramgaon to contribute
towards the memorial.
Gandhi was accompanied by his wife and one Chintaman Sakharam Davle, a
member of the Servants of India Society.

AHMEDABAD ,

December 3 [1915]
MY DEAR FRIEND,

I am today at a place1 in Kathiawad collecting subscriptions for
the Servants of India Society. There is a member of the society with
me. We have been accommodated in a beautiful cottage built on a
splendid hill commanding a fine view of the country. The place has a
population of 7,000 men. It has 300 handlooms. It is ruled by an
Indian prince having limited jurisdiction within his own state.
I shall not see your letter yet for two days perhaps. It must have
been received at Ahmedabad yesterday.
Mrs. Gandhi is with me.
Yours as ever,

GONDAL,

Kartak Vad 13 [Saturday, December 4, 1915] 1
DEAR MAGANBHAI,

I have your letter. Nearly Rs. 825 was collected at Wankaner. 2
With some more contributions coming in the amount may go up to a
thousand. A meeting was held at Gondal too.3 What the result will be it
is difficult to say. Jamnadas is with me. Ba is at Rajkot.
With me being away the atmosphere may tend to change. You
must work with faith to see that it does not change. Even if it should
change, if you do not succumb to the change it will change
automatically again. We must remember that the Ashram is still in its
infancy.4 It is necessary for me to spend some time there. Will such an
opportunity come?

83. SPEECH AT GONDAL ON GOKHALE5
December 4, 1915
Gokhale was so great a man that his death is mourned by 330
million Indians. Right up to the moment of death, he thought only of
service to the country; the Servants of India Society was his very life
to him. I came into closer contact with him than others did and I
observed that he was a man of great capacity. He knew both how to
live and how to die.

You have asked good questions. Krishnasamy cannot thus ask
for fresh rotis, nor send registered letters. He must read Gujarati. And
if he has already decided to leave after one year, he cannot even stay
there. You handle him as best as you can. Or leave the matter to await
my return. He ought to be told to do grinding.
I do not think it is proper to remind Sundaram about his studies
as long as he is ill.
You have not sent me the rules of the Ashram. I have to be at
Bhavnagar till Thursday. I shall be at Amreli on Friday.
You must have received my other letters.
There is good progress everywhere. The collection at Wankaner
will be Rs. 1,000. How are Shanti and Bhaiya?

BHAVNAGAR,

[On or after December 7, 1915] 2
Dignity of labour means that students should wash their own
clothes and do their own personal work like cooking, cleaning of
utensils and so on. They should abandon any false sense of shame in
body-labour.
I am against machines because big industries like steel and coal
dehumanize men. Rather than destroy big and small industries we
must establish a balance between them and give first place to village
industries.
I do accept the importance of primary education. But I know
many person who cannot read and write, yet are able to work
efficiently, because of their intuitive understanding. Hence, we cannot
afford to wait for education.
History today teaches strife, treachery and intrigue, whereas it
should give greater importance to noble deeds.
Man has no right to drink milk, because whether in human
beings or animals nature has intended milk only for the young. Hence
whatever the arguments, there is no justification for drinking milk.
I believe in varnashramadharma but I do not believe in castes.
Vranashramadharma means that a man should find satisfaction in
getting his livelihood from his ancestral occupation.
I am always in quest of truth. For the sake of truth I have
abandoned many of my ideas and acquired new ones. I have never
hesitated to give up the old and accept the new and will never hesitate
as long as I live.

FUND1
December 8, 1915
He [Gandhiji] expressed his great happiness at the unprecedented enthusiasm
displayed by the people of Bhavnagar that day and the day before and offered them his
heartfelt thanks. He gave very useful advice to students and youth in general, appealed
to the people of Bhavnagar to subscribe to the Memorial Fund for his guru, the late
widely-respected Hon’ble Mr. Gopal Krishna Gokhale and explained the aims of the
Servants of India Society established by him as also the great things expected of it.
Proceeding, he said:

I was invited four months ago by the people of Bhavnagar to
visit this place, but I could not do so then owing to certain
circumstances. But now that I am here, I see that my not coming here
then has in a way furthered the purpose of my visit, for then Sir
Prabhashanker was not here and, now that he is here, I have had the
honour of receiving this address from the blessed hands of so popular
an officer as he; what is more, there will be—I am perfectly sure of
this—a most substantial gain to the Memorial Fund for the late
Hon’ble Mr. Gokhale for which I have especially come here.

deserve it, for I have rendered no service to the community. Besides,
my friends and members of the community ask me sometimes what

cannot keep with me a thing like this1 made of silver, since I observe
the rule of non-possession. If I do, a thief may try to steal it and I may
then have to resort to violence for protecting it; this, again, will violate

I have received your mail from Bagasara. If you wish to pay a
visit to Dharmaj, you may do so after I come. I am worried all the
time that Shanti has still not got over his cough and Shivprasad is not
rallying; I fret about it night and day. I am making enquiries. I am
also consulting vaidyas. Do we suffer from some major deficiency?
We must find out what it is and where it lies. The visit to Porbundar is
off. We shall reach Limbdi on Monday evening. We shall go to
Wadhwan on Tuesday. We shall be at Limbdi on Tuesday till 3
o’clock. Hence it will be all right if you send the next post to the Free
Library at Wadhwan. From Wadhwan we shall go to Dhrangadhra on
Wednesday, expecting to be back the same day. Hence that day’s post
can also be sent to Wadhwan. We expect to reach Viramgam on

Sunday [December 12, 1915]
BHAISHRI 1 MAGANBHAI,

I visited Bagasara today. I got another batch of letters there.
There was one from Shivpujan too. His argument seems to be correct.
We cannot experiment with the children who are put in our charge.
Therefore, if you consider it necessary, please introduce immediately
provision of ghee and milk for the sick and for others who desire to
take these. Supply ghee to those who want it and arrange to get milk
in sufficient quantity. I think there is need to effect this change and
watch matters for a few months. It is certainly bad that so many
should be in poor health. If anyone needs buttermilk, we should give
it to him and see. Nobody should deprive himself of ghee from
shyness. Only those who are under a vow may abstain from ghee, or
those who even though not under a vow want to do without it. Shanti
should not be given oil even in vegetables. The expenditure on dried
fruit should be brought down.
Shivpujan complains of undercooking. Look into the matter.
Everything should be cooked well even if it takes more time.
I have nothing to say about the money sent for Anna. Both of
you enjoy a certain position and so what you have done at the
moment can be justified. This cannot be done for Mama 2 . Payment
could not be made to Krishnaswamy because there was no question of
his becoming manager. Mama of course has almost reached the
position of manager. Moreover in such work we must have one strict
rule.
I am sending Shivpujan’s letter for you to see. Be more lenient,
not less, in my absence. I do not wish that the students should have
complaints to make against you. It is necessary that Shivprasad,
Shanti, Chhotam and others should get well at once. Give milk to
Sundaram. He can have only a dhoti which we all have. We cannot

December 12, 1915
Mohanlal [sic] Karamchand Gandhi was in Bagasra on the 12th instant,
coming via Hadala from Amreli. He was accompanied by Darbar Shri Vajsurwala, of
Hadala, Devchand Uttamchand, Bar-at-Law of Jetpur, his son and a man from Rajkot.
Vakil Chhaganlal Ghordhan gave an address of welcome to Gandhi.
Gandhi in reply said he would now try his best to get Government to abolish
the Customs arrangements at Viramgaon.2 His ostensible reason for touring
Kathiawar was to collect subscriptions for the Gokhale Memorial Fund. He collected
some Rs. 250 at the meeting.
On the 15th December Gandhi visited Wadhwan City and Camp when he
addressed meetings and asked for subscriptions towards the Fund. He went to
Dhrangadhra by the 1.15 p.m. train the same day.

Mr. Gokhale. He urged them to insist on the abolition of the system even while the
war was going on.

100. SPEECH ON INDIA AND THE COLONIES AT BOMBAY
CONGRESS SESSION
December 28, 1915
Mr. M. K. Gandhi (Bombay) moved Resolution X regarding India and the
Colonies on 28th December 1915 at the 30th Indian National Congress session held
at Bombay.

He said:
MR. PRESIDENT AND FRIENDS,

The resolution that stands in my name reads thus:
88

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

This Congress regrets that the existing laws affecting Indians in
South Africa and Canada have not, in spite of the liberal and
imperialistic declarations of Colonial statesmen, been justly and
equally administered and this Congress trusts that the self-governing
Colonies will extend to the Indian emigrants equal rights with
European emigrants and that theImperial Government will use all
possible means to secure the rights which have been hitherto unjustly
withheld from them, thus causing widespread dissatisfaction and
discontent.
May I please appeal to the Press to alter the word “equally” to
“equitably” because that was the word given last night at the Subjects
Committee meeting?
Friends, it is an irony of fate that, whilst this vast assembly will
be regretting the attitude, the hostile attitude that has been adopted by
the self-governing Colonies, a contingent of your countrymen formed
in South Africa will be nearing the theatre of war in order to help the
sick and the wounded. I am in possession of facts in connection with
this contingent formed in South Africa, which shows that it is
composed of the middle classes which, according to The Times of
India, are going to form the future self-governing nation. These men
are drawn from ex-indentured Indians and their children; they are
drawn from the petty hawkers, the toilers and the traders—all these
men compose this great contingent. And yet the Colonies do not
consider it necessary to alter their attitude, nor do I see the logic in
their altering their policy. It is the fashion now-a-days to consider that
because we have taken our humble share in the war by not being
disloyal to the Government at the present juncture, we are entitled to
rights which have been hitherto withheld from us as if those rights
were withheld from us because our loyalty was suspected. No, my
friends. If they have been withheld from us, the reasons are different
and those reasons will have to be altered. They are due, some of them,
to undying prejudices; they are due, some of them, to economic
causes and these will have to be examined. The prejudices will have to
be borne down.
What are the hardships that our countrymen are labouring under
in South Africa, in Canada and in the other self-governing Colonies?
In South Africa, the settlement of 1914 secured what the passive
resisters were fighting for and nothing more and they were fighting
for the restoration of legal equality in connection with emigration
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

89

from British India and certain other things. That legal equality has
been restored, the other things granted, but the domestic troubles still
remain, and if it was not the custom unfortunately inherited for the
last thirty years that the language, the predominant language in the
assembly, should be English, our Madras friends will have taken good
care to learn one of the northern vernaculars and then there are
men enough from South Africa who would tell you in
one of our own tongues the difficulties that we have to go through
even now in South Africa. They are in connection with the holding
oflanded property; they are in connection with men who, having been
once domiciled in South Africa, return to South Africa; there are
difficulties in connection with the admission of their children and in
connection with trade licences. These are, it I may call them so, bread
and butter difficulties. There are other difficulties which I shall not
enumerate just now. In Canada, it is not possible for those brave Sikhs
who are domiciled there to bring their wives and children. (Cries of
“Shame”.) That is the difficulty in Canada. The law is the same but
the administration is vilely unequal. I feel that this unequal
administration will not be altered because of the splendid aid which
India is said to have rendered to the Empire.
Then how are these difficulties to be met? I do not intend to go
into details, but the Congress proposes that this difficulty can be met
by an appeal to the sense of justice of Colonial statesmen and by an
appeal to the Imperial Government. I fear that the Congress can only
do this. Lord Hardinge, only a few months ago, made a fervent appeal
to Indian publicists and to Indian statesmen for helping him to come
to an honourable solution which will retain the dignity of India and at
the same time not cause any trouble to the self-governing Colonies.
Lord Hardinge is still waiting for an answer. That answer is not
supplied by the Congress nor can it be supplied by the Congress. It
has to be supplied by associations such as the Imperial Citizenship
Association, the specialists, if I may call them so. The Congress has
given them the lead and it is for these associations to frame the details
in which they will have to examine the rival claims and offer to Lord
Hardinge a detailed solution, a solution which will satisfy the Colonial
Governments as well as the Indian people and will not take away any
thing whatsoever from the just demands that this resolution makes.
With these words, I have much pleasure in proposing this resolution.
(Loud applause.)

106. SPEECH AT ARYA SAMAJ ANNUAL CELEBRATIONS,
SURAT
January 2, 1916
You have laid me under a heavy debt by inviting me to attend
this function and declare open the Arya Samaj temple and I am
thankful likewise to the Samaj and to the people of Surat for asking
me to preside over this celebration. Let me tell you at the outset that I
am not an Aryasamajist, as members of the Samaj, and others as well,
know. At the same time, I ought to say that I bear no ill-will to the
Samaj either. I am not a member of this body just as I am not a
member of any other body. There are numerous other bodies like the
Arya Samaj in India and they all do their best by way of service, but I
have especial respect for the Samaj. I have developed good relations
with Munshiramji of the Gurukul at Hardwar. My sons and other
friends of mine had occasion to stay in that Gurukul2 and it is not easy
to forget the love which prompted all that was done for them. The
whole of India knows its work as much as I do. Swami Dayanand, the
adored founder of the Samaj, was a rare man and I must acknowledge
that I have come under his influence. I have had occasion to talk
about the Arya Samaj at many places. In my opinion, the Samaj could

The Phoenix party had stayed at Gurukul for some time and, in 1915 at the

do very useful work if some change was brought about in it. What
needs to be changed is this,—that some of the spokesmen of the
Samaj seem to be only too ready to enter into violent controversy to
gain their end. They could, however, achieve their purpose without
recourse to controversy. I discussed this matter in Hardwar and
mention it again here today. The service that the Arya Samaj renders
is not different from that of the Hindu religion. If one examines
different bodies like the Brahmo Samaj1 , the Sikh Samaj, etc., one sees
that all of them express the truths of the Hindu religion. Only the
names differ. Just as individual persons are mentioned by name for
the purpose of a census, so are the various sects listed with some
public good in view. If you examine the basic principles of all the
sects, they will be found to differ in no way from those of the Hindu
religion. The trend of the discussions at present going on shows
unmistakably that a time will certainly come when all the sects of
Hindus will be included under the single term “Hinduism”. There are
different religious groups in India like Hindus, Parsis, Muslims and so
on, but for purposes of national work they all get united. This will
show that the spirit of religion is active in all. Let it be remembered
that without this spirit, no great task was ever ventured upon or ever
will be. I shall now make a few observations I feel like making on this
occasion. They will serve my own purpose and will also help me to
discharge my duty. I have been given half an hour now and one hour
in the evening, a total of one and a half hours, for speaking, but it is
beyond me to speak so long and see that you digest all that I say. I
like to have the shortest possible time for a speech and I have had
good experience in the matter. I have been at a good many places
during the last 30 years and I have noticed that where there is much
speaking, there is little work. This charge has long been made against
the whole of India. It is made by Europeans, that is, by people from
the West. We deserve it. It has been remarked even at a session of the
Congress that we are fed only on speeches and discourses. When shall
we break free of this? We are very much at fault on this count and
find ourselves in a miserable plight in consequence. As you know,
there is much hunger in India, and it has always been hunger for
spiritual food. If, on occasions of such celebrations, the day is spent
merely in listening to speeches for seven or eight hours, when can we
have time for work? If we had spent as much of our lives in work as
1

124

A socio-religious reform movement started by Raja Ram Mohan Roy
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

we have in listening to speeches, how much could have been
accomplished in India by now. If we had spent in doing sums in
arithmetic all the time we wasted on speeches, I think India would be
now on the threshold of swaraj. We shall never get swaraj by listening
to speeches and discourses, sitting in pandals like this. It is to be had
only through sacrifice of self and by making ourselves worthy of it. I
brought up this matter for discussion in the Congress session, at
Hardwar and wherever else I went and, having got this opportunity
today, place it before you. Whenever I have occasion to speak, I have
my say in brief and I shall continue to follow that practice. I appeal to
the speakers [today] to proceed apace likewise. We arrange
programmes of as many as seven hours of speeches at these
gatherings. If the men who have assembled here were given a hoe and
a shovel each and made to work at digging the land here for that
number of hours, and the land were sown, we should certainly have a
good crop next year. If I could take the leading workers of the Arya
Samaj round the town and make them clean up the dirty spots, they
would certainly earn the gratitude of the people of Surat. We see that
the people of the West are more keen on work than on speeches. If at
all you want to imitate them, imitate them in their good qualities. You
will learn much therefrom. If, instead, you adopt foreign ways from
them, you will invite your undoing. If we could reduce the
programme of speeches today from seven to four hours and give the
three hours thus saved to doing something useful, the time would be
better spent. If merely listening to speeches could accomplish
anything or cure our ailments, why, they arrange reading from the
Bhagavat at so many places and these draw large audiences, but we
shall find on several of these occasions that quite a few in the audience
are dozing. If we could get everything by submitting to speeches, we
need do nothing else. Only let the Brahmins go on with their readings
from holy books and Puranas and our salvation would be assured.
Indians, thus enjoy speaking and hearing others speak and paying
compliments to themselves. They go to extremes in these matters. If,
instead, we were to hold our tongues, there is much we could learn.
Speaking hinders reflection. If, on the other hand, you do something,
be it what it may, that will lead to a discussion and the people will be
enabled to draw some lesson from it. I would, therefore, entreat you to
employ every available minute in doing your duty. A great saint has
said that, if at any time too many ideas rush into one’s mind. one
should not lose one’s judgement. One should not act upon them
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

immediately. One should sleep over them for a night and examine
them with oneself from every point of view so as to cast out such of
them as are of no value, discuss the rest with one’s wife, exchange
views with her and cut out those which are found unsound. The idea
that remains at the end, if one feels with all one’s soul that it is true,
one may act upon it and place it before the world undeterred by any
attacks that may follow. Only an idea that is held with such conviction
can be translated into action, and no time will be wasted in
consequence. I respectfully submit that it is very necessary to take full
thought before embarking upon any course of action. It will be
impudence on my part to tell you what ought to be done. By my
saying so, moreover, the thing will not be done. What I have told you
today is but my own experience and I would humbly request you,
therefore, to accept from it only what may appeal to you as right.
Rather than imitate the West, it would be far more profitable to us to
reject everything that they offer us. If only you consider, they don’t
have speeches in Europe as we have, for they get no time to listen to
any. In order to make the progress that they are making, there are
certain rights we must demand and secure from the Government. For
that purpose, we must get ready for a struggle. I know that the honour
people give me these days is because of the fight I gave to the
Government for securing our rights and because of the suffering I
went through in doing so. We have to deserve such rights. May you,
therefore, read and think and learn from others in order to make
yourselves so worthy and be fit to give a fight to the Government
along the path of truth! If the workers of this Samaj take the lead in
doing this duty, that would be more profitable. With these words I
request your permission to resume my seat.
Replying to some observations of the speakers who followed him, Gandhiji
said:
It is not enough that today, acting upon a hint from me, you did not indulge in
long speeches to make things easy for me. It will make me happier to know that you
will never do so. Pandit Ramchandraji put me an important question in the course of
his speech. He asked me to say how the world of the Arya Samaj could be made more
useful and popular. It is not only here that the question has come up. It was also
discussed when I was at Hardwar. I have no time just now to answer it. I shall argue
with Panditshri about it if he visits me at Ahmedabad. It will also be necessary to take
into account the views of those who have different ideas on the subject. I was asked
by my guru, the late Mr. Gokhale, not to get involved in such controversies and

126

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

hence I avoid them. This is not a controversy, however, with people not one’s own. I
look upon members of this Samaj as my friends and I owe it to them to offer my
advice. I have been tested on the anvil and have stood the test; it is my duty,
therefore, to share my experience with my friends. We must strive every day for
India’s progress.1 In reply to one Balkrishna who argued against Gandhiji’s advice to
refrain from controversies, he said:

Following the advice of my guru, Mr. Gokhale, I do not enter
into argument with anyone. With the new year, I must remind myself
of this and, since the issue has come up, I shall say that it is a very
delicate one and the question cannot therefore be answered without
some discussion. I am not partial to anyone. If I feel that I can serve
India better by becoming a member of the Samaj, I will become one
and when I feel that way, I shall immediately say so in public. At the
moment, I cannot give any reply to Mr. Balkrishna. However, if he
comes to Ahmedabad any time, I shall discuss the matter with him and
satisfy him.2

107. SPEECH AT SURAT ON PLACE OF ENGLISH3
January 3, 1916
It is very surprising that students who deliver speeches in
English do not see whether or not the audience can follow what they
say. Nor do they consider whether those who understand English will
feel interested or bored by their broken, incorrect English. It is a sad
state of affairs that growing young people turn away from their own
mother tongue and become such devoted lovers of a foreign
language. Those who argue that a new era has come to prevail in our
country through foreign contacts, how much do they care to explain
their new ideas to the people around them? They ought to consider
whether the new era will draw closer or recede farther by their prating
in a language which their parents do not know, which their brothers
and sisters do not know, and their servants, wives, children and

kinsfolk cannot follow. There are some who think that English is our
national language and that sooner or later it will be the language of all
the people of the country, but this does not seem correct to me. If we
take a handful of persons who have received English education to be
the nation, it must be said that we do not understand the meaning of
the word “nation”. I am sure it can never happen that 300 million
people will pick up English, so that it becomes our national language.
Those who have been fortunate enough to acquire new knowledge
and new ideas must explain their ideas to their friends? kinsfolk and
fellow-countrymen. To those young men who argue that they cannot
express their ideas in their own language, I can only say that they are
a burden to the motherland. It does not become any son worthy of the
name to slight his mother tongue, to turn away his face from it, instead
of removing what imperfections it may have. If we of the present
generation neglect the mother tongue, future generations will have
occasion to feel sorry for us. We shall never cease being reproached
by them. I hope that all the students present here will take a vow that
they will not use English at home unless it is absolutely necessary to
do so.
Parents also should be on their guard against being carried away
by the tide of the modern age. We do want the English language, but
we do not want it to destroy our own language. Our societywill be
reformed only through our own language. We can ensure simplicity
and dignity in communication only through our own language.
Students, and their parents as well, should all aspire for a high level of
proficiency in their own tongue. If this library opened by me helps to
weaken rather than nourish our language, I cannot help feeling sorry
when I hear of the fact.

109. SPEECH AT ARYA SAMAJ FUNCTION, SURAT3
January 3, 1916
SISTERS AND BROTHERS,

I should have been here at two but I could not; kindly forgive
me for that. I find myself in difficulties wherever I go. I have one or
two days at my disposal and too many people to meet and too many
places to see, with the result that I cannot always manage to be
punctual. Nor can I deny myself to anyone. Yesterday, a subject was
suggested to me for a speech, but I did not like to speak on it. It has
again been suggested today. I shall, therefore, as desired, place before
you what few ideas I can. We find everyone in India in a state of fear,
so much so that a father and a son dare not speak frankly to each
other. The reason for this, you will find, is that it has become difficult
to speak the truth. One is always in doubt whether one’s words will
please the other person or not. So long as this is our condition, we
shall never be able to speak the truth. While this state of fear
continues, we shall always remain backward and shall always be
dogged by misery. From the prevalent atmosphere, it seems that the
people are eager for something to be done. What is that something?

Allow me to point out that we shall have to suffer whatever work we
take up. In taking up any work, we must first decide on the course we
want to follow and then go ahead fearlessly. We are afraid at the sight
of a policeman. We feel afraid if it is but a station-master. Why this
fear? It is there because we are afraid of speaking the truth. Though
they are men in authority, they are in a way our servants, since their
services are paid for from public revenues. Why, then, should we be
afraid of those whom we have ourselves appointed? Only when people
become fearless will they wipe out this charge of timidity. I would say
that fear springs in a man from within, that no one puts the fear into
him. If you stand by the side of a wild animal, like a tiger, utterly
fearless, he will play with you; if you try to run away, he will kill you.
If, for example, you run because of the barking of a dog, he will run
after you, but he will play with you if you face him fearlessly.
Government officers are in fact our servants. We should entertain no
fear of them, though we should not behave rudely to them either.
There must be courtesy even in dealing with servants. We should
follow truth, and be fearless in doing so. A coward is himself afraid
and fills others with fear. Such is the condition of affairs in families
and communities. Where, then, shall we voice the demand for reform?
Everyone who desires reform in his community only talks about the
matter before others, saying: “Oh yes! There is need for such a
reform, certainly. But you know what our community is like! The
members would raise a storm.” To be afraid in this way and do
nothing is no credit to one’s manliness. The other members of the
community would not feel for our daughter as we do. I know the way
caste affairs are managed; everywhere there is the same story. Parents
remain in great fear for their daughters. Any reform that is necessary
in this matter must be carried out. If that is not done, to what end do
bodies like the Arya Samaj exist? The poet Akha has said; “Live as
you will, Realize God anyhow, anyway.”
We are to seek Hari1 through these activities. We cannot attain
Him till we have realized the self. This country is ever in the forefront
with words, but hindmost in action. This charge against our country
must go, however. It was my experience in South Africa that people
spoke with a profuse flow of words at meetings, declared themselves
ready in their speeches even for imprisonment, but, when the testing
time came, they made themselves scarce. A man is one person when
1

speaking and another when the time for action comes. Then, fear
takes possession of his heart. Till you have driven out that fear, you
will make no progress, material or spiritual. People in India will know
real life only when they have shed all fear. The country has a
population of three hundred million. Even if only a few of these come
forward, they will give a lead to the rest. One good coin is of greater
worth than millions of bad ones. With these words, I beg leave to
resume my seat. I should tell you that I have yet another appointment
elsewhere. Kindly give me leave, therefore, and go on with the rest of
the programme.

110. SPEECH AT SURAT RECEPTION1
January 3, 1916
SISTERS AND BROTHERS,

I have grown weary listening to my praises on this occasion and
I am sure you too are tired, as it has grown so late, and you must be
disinclined to hear a long speech. That you all shout ‘no’ means
nothing in particular; I know it only signifies our good manners in
India. I thank you very much indeed for the sentiments you have
expressed about my wife. The reason, as far as I know for all that is
being said about me and my wife is that the sentiments the
high-souled Shri Gokhale expressed about us here 2 , in India, are still
echoing. We, husband and wife, were not the only ones in South
Africa to have gone to gaol; there were many others. A young girl of
17, fresh from Vanitavishram3 , went to gaol, and her husband too.
While in gaol, he died of an illness. It has become a custom in India to
show respect to anyone who happens to be present. India needs to
wake up; without an awakening, there can be no progress. To bring it
about in the country, one must place some programme before it. The
question then is: how to bring about awakening and spread
understanding in the country. I had a key with me for this purpose; it
was this: I first learnt the language of the people through whom I had

to work and I told them, in their own language, of the situation in
which I found myself, seeking from them the line of action which
would best meet the needs of that situation. It was entirely because of
this approach that they could appreciate the situation as I saw it and
they came to my help. Then, again, once on coming out of gaol I
received a letter, telling me that the leaders had left and asking me
what I could do by myself. But lo! 20,000 men were afire without
there being anyone to lead them—such is the experience I have had.
What did it matter if all had left? If, therefore, you desire to work for
the good of India, give primary education to its three hundred million
people, not the kind of education that goes by that name at present
but such education as will impart to them the knowledge that is
required in these times. Teach them why it is that India is growing
more and more abject. The poor and the illiterate should know that
this is happening because they are being deprived of everything. In
consequence of this abject attitude, men are in a constant state of fear
and are afraid of anyone in authority, even a policeman. There is so
much of fear in India today that a father and a son distrust each other
and cannot exchange ideas. We should, therefore, spread the right
kind of knowledge in order that we might end this state of affairs. I
came by such knowledge in 1896 in a mantra1 I learnt from the late
Mr. Gokhale. Surat is a city of heroes. Blessed by the poet Narmad2 , it
enjoys immortal fame. It has suffered frequently from the ravages of
fire and flood but it continues on its even course, fair to all. From the
very same city of Surat came Ahmad Mahomed 3 and Sorabji
Shapurji4 , who carried on a brave fight in South Africa and were
imprisoned again and again but did not lose heart in the least. Such
are the heroes who belong to Surat and I have great respect for this
town. When I returned to India, I wanted that my first visit should be
to Surat but unforeseen circumstances prevented this. I am extremely
grateful to the people of this city for the affection they have showered
on me today. I hope that you will continue to give me the same love
and help me whenever I need your services. I don’t propose to spend
away what I have saved from my earnings, for I am a bania. I shall

ask for any money from you for my own purpose. But I only hope
that anything that I may ask for a public cause, you will be generous
enough to give. What I want from you is some contribution to the
Memorial Fund for the late Mr. Gokhale. I have been able to collect
thirteen to fourteen thousand from towns in Kathiawar and I hope I
shall get a good sum from a city like Surat. I have heard that Surat has
done nothing in this matter, I called today on Mr. Adwani, the District
Judges and mentioned the matter to him. He told me that nothing had
been done about it; but that he would be happy if something was
done, that he encouraged such an effort and would agree to put down
Rs. 50/- as his contribution. You know how very important this project
is. It is necessary to preserve Mr. Gokhale’s legacy. And so let
everyone, from the highest to the lowest, give anything he thinks fit. It
has been said of Surat that it is slow to be roused but that, when need
arises, it wakes up and does what no other city will be able to do. Once
again, I thank the people of Surat for the great love they have shown
me and beg leave to resume my seat.

111. SPEECH AT MAHOMEDAN ASSOCIATION, SURAT1
January 3, 1916
This gathering reminds me of South Africa, where the Hindus,
Parsis and Muslims had become one. I find here in Surat the same
bond of brotherhood between Hindus and Muslims which I have
found wherever I have moved in India. From among my old friends
in South Africa whom I have met here, Abdul Kadir Bawazeer shared
much suffering with me. If I were to speak about that, I would take
long and I don’t have all that time. I shall, therefore, tell you in brief
that I returned to India with the desire to render equal service to both
the communities, Hindus and Muslims. We shall accomplish the tasks
that face us in India only when my Hindu, Muslim and Parsi brethren
feel that they are all one. It would be best if the community that
happened to be in the majority [at any place] realized that it was for

that community to see that there were no quarrels. The leaders of each
community should regard themselves as belonging to both
communities and lead any movement accordingly. With the growth of
brotherly relations between these two communities, you will have
better zeal for work. In South Africa, Hindus and Muslims live as
brothers. In a right cause, a community can win even if it fights
single-handed. It is the same God, service to whom ensures our
salvation; if, then, our two communities live in harmony, we shall have
all that we want dropping into our hands, so to say. To ensure this, we
must behave with no fear in our hearts, and with a mind that is ever the
same. Finally, I thank you for the kind things you have said in your
address and in the speeches and pray to God that I may make no
distinction of Hindu and Muslim and may ever serve both. May you
also pray likewise.

January 4, 1916
The places of birth of satyagrahis are for me places of
pilgrimage, and so I am here on a pilgrimage. It would be greatly for
India’s good if our people were like the late Mr. Hoosen Dawad2 . You
can achieve much if you follow his example. When in Surat, I called
on Mr. Hudson, the Collector. On my requesting him to be of help to
the Indians going to South Africa, he asked me how he could help
those who wanted to secure false certificates on the basis of incorrect
statements. I would advise you, therefore, not to follow such practices.
Going to South Africa is likely to bring you no great profit. We
should rather strive to earn honestly whatever we can here in India. I
shall value the honour you are now doing me only if I find when I
visit this place again that you have followed my advice.

January 4, 1916
I have come here to see an old friend of mine. Hindus and
Muslims should become united; that is the desire I have expressed at
every place. I hope both these communities will help me. When I
started from Kathor in a small bullock-cart; I was in a hurry and as I
wished, for the sake of my personal convenience, to reach here early, I
did not mind when bullocks were struck with a goad. Hinduism,
however, teaches us that we should not hurt cows and bullocks. The
sacred book of Islam stresses the importance of compassion. I felt that
it was cruel to strike bullocks with a goad. In England, this is a
punishable offence, but here no action is taken in the matter. The
scriptures of both the religions lay down that we should not inflict
cruelty on even the meanest of creatures. I also will have to answer for
this in the court of the Almighty. When I come here again, it will
make me happy to see that the sticks are no longer spiked. If I do not
find that you have done so., I shall prefer going on foot rather than in
the bullock-cart. We should not strike animals which happen to be
weak. Let us remember that if any person strikes us, we abuse him.
Finally, I thank you for the kindness shown to me.

January 5, 1916
Gentlemen, I am sorry I could not be here before you yesterday
and you had all, therefore, to go back disappointed. 1 We, satyagrahis,
can have our way in everything on which we set our heart, but in the
face of an accident we are helpless. I am grateful to you all for your
being so full of love and respect for me. The credit for the work done
by me in South Africa should go to Fakira Koli 2 and others who
helped me. What I did there was to explain dearly to my countrymen
the new laws enacted there and get them amended through satyagraha.
My efforts were for the most part successful. I could guide the people
there along the right path. In India, I find things are different. Here, if
I asked people to go through some suffering, they would turn their
back in fear. I pray to God to give me strength that I might do some
little service to my country and my countrymen. Navsari3 owes much
to its Parsi population. I congratulate this small community, which
plays a leading part in every field. Relatively to other [Indian]
communities in South Africa, this community is so small that its
members are as the little stones found in a heap of wheat. Even so, the
Parsis played their part very bravely, and Parsee Rustomjee especially
deserves great honour.4 I express my thanks to you all for the great
honour the members of the Koli community and other gentlemen
have done me.
Refusing the silver casket presented along with the address, Gandhiji said:

DEAR MR. SHASTRIAR,

You have anticipated me. I had told Dr. Deva that I would place
my conclusions before you, if possible, during the Congress week. I
was unable to do so. Now, however, that the members have already
begun to consider the question, perhaps it is unnecessary for me to set
forth my conclusions. The members are coming to a just decision in
not having me as a member. Whilst there is possibility of co-operation
when we are working independently, I can see that I would, as a
member, become a disturbing factor. The methods of the Society as
such are so totally different from mine in many respects. Our
common discipleship would constitute an indissoluble bond though
we would be following out Mr. Gokhale’s work from different viewpoints.1

119. MESSAGE OF GOKHALE’S LIFE1
[Before February 4, 1916]
All that you do, and all you enjoy,
What you offer in sacrifice, what you give in charity,
All austerities that you go through,
Render up everything to me.2
When, smiling and playing my way through life,
I see Hari revealed to me, a visible presence,
Then shall I consider my life
To have attained its true end.
Muktanand’s3 Lord, who sports with us,
O Odha4 ! He is the thread of our lives.
The counsel Shri Krishna addressed to Arjuna was, as it were,
addressed by Lady India to Mahatma Gokhale and taken to heart by
the latter, such was the manner of life of this great, departed soul. It
is a fact known to everyone that all his activities, all his joys and
thesacrifices he made, all the suffering he went through, were
dedicated to Mother India.
The state of Odhava’s mind5 with regard to Shri Krishna, as
depicted by Muktanand, was that of the late Gokhale with regard to
India.
What is the message of a life such as this? The Mahatma did not
leave even this unsaid. When dying, he sent for the members of the
Servants of India Society who were then present and told them: “Do

not occupy yourselves with writing my biography or spend your time
in putting up my statues. If you are true servants of India, dedicate
your lives to the fulfilment of our aims, to the service of India.” We
know, too, what he felt in his heart about the meaning of that service.
The Congress should of course be kept alive, the true condition of the
country should be placed before the people through speeches and
writings and efforts made to have education provided to every Indian.
What was the aim behind all this? And how was it to be realized? In
answering these questions, we get to know his point of view. Framing a
constitution for the Servants [of India] Society, he laid down that the
duty of its members would be to spiritualize political life in India.
This embraces everything. His was a religious life. My soul stands
witness that, in all that he did, at all times, he acted wholly in the spirit
of religion. Some twenty years ago, this Mahatma’s sentiments
sometimes appeared to be those of an atheist. He said once: “I don’t
have Ranade’s1 faith. How I should like to have it!” Even at that time,
however, I could see a religious bent of mind in his actions. It would
not be wrong to say that his very doubt proceeded from such a bent
of mind. He who lives in the manner of a sadhu, whose desires are
simple, who is the image of truth, is full of humility, who represents
the very essence of truth and has wholly renounced his ego, such a
one is a holy soul, whether he knows it or not. Such a one was
Mahatma Gokhale, as I could see from my twenty years’ acquaintance
with him.
In 1896, I discussed [with leaders] in India the question of indentured labour in Natal. At that time, I knew the Indian leaders only
by name. This was the first occasion when I had contact with he leaders at Calcutta, Bombay, Poona and Madras. The late Gokhale was
then known as a follower of Ranade. He had already at this time dedicated his life to the Fergusson College. I was a mere youth, with no
experience. The bond which developed between us on the occasion of
our very first meeting in Poona never came to exist between any other
leader and me. Sure enough, all that I had heard about Mahatma
Gokhale was confirmed by my own experience; but especially the
effect which the soft expression on his lotus-like face had on me has
still not vanished from my mind. I instantly recognized him as
dharma incarnate. I had an audience with Shri Ranade, too, at that

time, but I could get no glimpse into his heart. I could only see him as
Gokhale’s mentor. Whether it was that he was much senior to me in
age and experience or that there were some other reasons, whatever
the reason, I could not understand Shri Ranade as well as I could
Gokhale.
After this contact with him in 1896, Gokhale’s political life be
came my ideal. That very time he took possession of my heart as my
guru in matters political. He edited the Quarterly of the Sarvajanik
Sabha, he made Fergusson College illustrious by teaching there. He
gave evidence before the Welby Commission1 and demonstrated his
true worth to India. He created so fine an impression on Lord Curzon2
by his ability that the latter, who feared none, feared him. By his
performance in the Central Legislative Assembly, he brought credit to
India. At the risk of his life, he served on the Public Service
Commission. He did all this and much more. Others have given a far
better account of these things than I could hope to. Moreover, one
cannot claim that his message, as I have understood it and defined it
here, may be clearly deduced from these actions of his. I, therefore
propose to conclude this article by relating what I have myself known
and what exemplifies his message.
The satyagraha struggle made so profound an impression on his
mind that, though his health absolutely forbade it, he decided to pay a
visit to South Africa. He went there in 1912. The Indians in South
Africa gave him a right royal welcome. On the very next day after his
arrival in Cape Town, there was a meeting in the local Town Hall. The
Mayor was in the chair. Gokhale was in no condition to attend
meetings and make speeches. But he left intact all the countless and
taxing engagements that had been fixed. Following this decision, he
attended the meeting in the Town Hall. At that very first appearance,
he conquered the hearts of the whites in Cape Town. Everyone felt
that a great soul was visiting South Africa. Mr. Merriman3 , a
prominent leader in South Africa and a man of character and liberal
views, had this to say when they met: “Sir, a visit by a person like you
brings a breath of fresh air into this land of ours.”

As the late Mr. Gokhale’s tour progressed, this first impression
became stronger. At every place the distinction between whites and
Coloureds was forgotten for the moment. There were meetings in all
places like the one held in Cape Town. The whites and Indians sat in
the same rows at these meetings and, according equal honour to the
late Mr. Gokhale, earned similar honour for themselves. There was a
dinner in his honour in Johannesburg. It was attended by nearly three
hundred prominent whites. The Mayor was in the chair. The whites in
Johannesburg are not likely to be awed by anyone. If they have some
multi-millionaires among them, they have also men who know
people’s worth. These vied with one another in shaking hands with
Mr. Gokhale. There was only one reason for this. In his speeches, the
audiences saw Gokhale’s overflowing love for his motherland and a
sense of fairness, at the same time. He wanted his country to be treated
with the fullest respect and honour but did not want that any other
country should be humiliated. If he was anxious to see all the rights of
his countrymen preserved, he was equally anxious to see that the
rights of others were not jeopardized in the process. Because of this,
everyone felt a genuine sweetness in his utterances.
Mr. Gokhale believed that he delivered in Johannesburg his best
speech1 in South Africa. It lasted more than three quarters of an hour
but I never felt that anyone in the audience was bored. How did he
make this speech? He started preparing for it six days in advance. He
acquainted himself with the history of the question, as much as was
necessary for his purpose, posted himself with the relevant figures and,
sitting up late the preceding night, got ready with his language. The
result was as I have stated. He satisfied both the whites and his own
people.
I shall never forget while I live the pains he took to prepare
himself for his meeting with Generals Botha and Smuts in Pretoria, the
capital of South Africa. On the day before the interview, he closely
examined Mr. Kallenbach and me. He got up at three o’clock and
woke us up. He had finished with the literature he had been supplied
and now wanted to cross-examine me, in order to make sure whether
he was fully prepared. I told him politely that he need not have
exerted himself so much, that we would fight it out if we obtained
nothing then, but that we did not want him to be sacrificed for our
sake. But how would a man, who had made it a rule to throw himself
1

In 1912

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

143

heart and soul into everything that he undertook, listen to my words?
How shall 1 describe his manner of cross-examining [me]? How shall
I praise his thoroughness? Such pains could have only one result. The
cabinet promised Mr. Gokhale that a Bill conceding the satyagrahis’
demands would be introduced in Parliament in the ensuing session
and that the annual tax of £3 on the indentured labourers would be
repealed. The promises were not kept at the time mentioned. Did Mr.
Gokhale hold his peace thereafter? Not for a moment. I am sure his
exertions in 1913 to secure the fulfilment of the promises must have
shortened his life by at least ten years. This is what his doctors believe.
It is difficult to give an idea of the labour he went through in that year
in rousing India and collecting funds. India was in an uproar about
the issue of South Africa. The power which brought this about was
Mr. Gokhale’s. Lord Hardinge made a speech in Madras 1 which will
go down in history. This too was owing to Gokhale. Those who were
the nearest to him bear witness that, worrying himself over the South
African issue, he became permanently bed-ridden. Even so, till the
very last he refused to rest. He would receive, at midnight, telegrams
from South Africa as long as letters. He attended to them immediately
and drafted a reply on the instant. A telegram would be sent to Lord
Hardinge the same moment and a statement for the Press prepared.
In attending to the question, he delayed his meal and delayed going
to bed, ignored the difference between day and night. Such
single-minded and selfless devotion would be possible only to an
elevated soul.
On the Hindu-Muslim question, too, his approach was ever the
most religious. Once a man dressed as a sadhu went to see him,
claiming to speak for Hindus. He would have the Muslims treated as
1
Replying to addresses of welcome of the Mahajan Sabha and Madras
Provincial Conference Committee at Madras on November 24, 1913, Lord Hardinge
said:
“Recently your compatriots in South Africa have taken matters into their own
hands by organising what is called passive resistance to laws which they consider
invidious and unjust—an opinion which we who watch their struggle from afar cannot
but share. They have violated as they intend to violate those laws with full knowledge
of the penalties involved and ready with all courage and patience to endure those
penalties. In all this they have the sympathy of India deep and burning and not only
of India but of all those who, like myself, without being Indians themselves, have
feelings of sympathy for the people of this country.” Vide “Lord Hardinge’s Speech”,
3-12-1913.

inferior and the Hindus as superior. When Mr. Gokhale refused to
play this game, he was accused of wanting in pride as a Hindu.
Knitting his brows, he replied in a voice that pierced the heart: “If
Hinduism consists in doing what you say, I am not a Hindu. Please
leave me.” One sannyasi left another and walked off.
Mr. Gokhale possessed in an eminent degree the quality of
fearlessness. Among the qualities that make for the religious way of
life this occupies almost the first place. There was a reign of terror in
Poona after the assassination of Lieutenant Rand1 . Mr. Gokhale was in
England at that time. He made a famous speech there in defence of
Poona. Some of the statements he made in that speech could not
subsequently be proved. After some time, he returned to India. He
apologized to the British troops against whom he had levelled charges.
This action even displeased a section of the Indian people. Some
persons advised the Mahatma to retire from public life. A few
ignorant Indians did not even hesitate to accuse him of pusillanimity.
To all of them, he replied in words at once earnest and gentle: “What
I have undertaken at no one’s order, I can abandon at no one’s order.
I should be happy to have popular opinion on my side while
performing my duty; should I not be so fortunate, however, that too
may be just as well.” He believed that one’s duty lay in working. I
never observed that while doing anything, he considered its effect on
popular opinion from the point of view of his personal fortunes. If it
ever became necessary to mount the gallows for the sake of the
country, I believe he had the strength to do so fearlessly and with a
smile on his face. I know that, often enough, mounting the gallows
would have been a far easier thing for him than to be in the condition
he had to pass through. He was in such painful situations more than
once but he never gave way.
All these instances would seem to point to this lesson, that if we
would learn anything from the life of this great patriot, it should be to
emulate his religious attitude. All of us cannot go into the Central
Legislative Assembly, nor do we always observe that doing so
necessarily means serving the nation. We all cannot join the Public
Service Commission and all those who do are not patriots. We may
not, everyone of us, acquire his learning, nor do we see that every

learned person is a servant of the country. All of us, however, can
cultivate virtues like fearlessness, truthfulness, fortitude, justice,
straightforwardness, firmness of purpose, and dedicate them to the
service of the nation. This is the religious way. This is what the
mahavakya1 , that political life should be spiritualized, means. He who
follows this line will always know the path he should take. He will earn
a share in the legacy left by the late Shri Gokhale. It is the divine
assurance that anyone acting in this spirit will come by all the other
gifts he needs. The life of the late Shri Gokhale is an irrefutable proof
of this.

122. SPEECH AT KASHI NAGARI PRACHARINI SABHA2
February 5, 1916
YOUR HIGHNESS AND BROTHERS,

I feel ashamed that before you I cannot speak well in Hindi. You
know that I used to live in South Africa. It was there that I learnt a
little Hindi while working with my Indian brethren. You will therefore
forgive me my failing.
I had not thought that I would have to speak at this gathering.
And I am not fit to deliver a speech. I have been told to say
something. Although it is beyond my capacity to say much, I shall
speak to you about a few things that come to my mind. You are
perhaps not aware that I have with me thirty to thirty-five men and
women. They have taken a pledge to use Hindi. I also corresponded
with this body. I was in need of some books which I could not get.
The Sabha has done something and I offer it my thanks and

congratulations and pray to God that it may increase its membership
every day. It should try to prepare the books that I wanted. Its
office-holders are all M.A.’s and B.A.’s and LL.B.’s and they have
read those books in English. From those of its office-holders who are
lawyers, I want to know whether they do their court work in English or
in Hindi. If they do it in English, I will say to them that they should
do it in Hindi. To those young men who are students, I will say that
they should take a vow to use Hindi for writing letters to one another.
Freedom cannot be gained without literature. People should
therefore bring to the masses the advanced thoughts and new ideas
that are available in English. Tomorrow Dr. J. C. Bose will be making
a speech. If he speaks in Bengali, I will have no quarrel with him. I
will have a quarrel with him if he speaks in English. It is the duty of
the Nagari Pracharini Sabha to translate into Hindi the books that Dr.
Bose has written in English. When a learned book is published in
Germany, the very next week it is translated into English. That is why
that language is so mature. It should be the same with Hindi. However
much people may exalt their own language, real glory will belong
only to the language which produces great scholars and that language
alone will spread in the country. If Tamil produces great scholars, we
shall all begin to speak Tamil. The language in which a poet like
Tulsidas wrote his poetry is certainly sacred and no language can
stand before it. Our chief task is to learn Hindi, but even so we shall
learn other languages also. If we learn Tamil, we shall be able to teach
Hindi to Tamil- speakers also.

123. SPEECH AT BENARES HINDU UNIVERSITY
February 6, 1916
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on February 4th1 on the
occasion of the opening of the Benares Hindu University. Gandhiji, who edited the
report for G. A. Natesan, wrote:

I have merely removed some of the verbiage which in cold print
would make the speech bad reading:
Friends, I wish to tender my humble apology for the long delay
1

148

Misprint for 6th

that took place before I was able to reach this place. And you will
readily accept the apology when I tell you that I am not responsible
for the delay nor is any human agency responsible for it. (Laughter.)
The fact is that I am like an animal on show and lay keepers in their
over-kindness always manage to neglect a necessary chapter in this
life and that is pure accident. In this case, they did not provide for the
series of accidents that happened to us—to me, my keepers! and my
carriers. Hence this delay.
Friends, under the influence of the matchless eloquence of the
lady (Mrs. Besant) who has just sat down, pray, do not believe that our
University has become a finished product and that all the young men
who are to come to the University that has yet to rise and come into
existence, have also come and returned from it finished citizens of a
great empire. Do not go away with any such impression and if you,
the student world to which my remarks are supposed to be addressed
this evening, consider for one moment that the spiritual life, for which
this country is noted and for which this country has no rival, can be
transmitted through the lip, pray, believe me you are wrong. You will
never be able merely through the lip to give the message that India, I
hope, will one day deliver to the world. I myself have been “fed up”
with speeches and lectures. I except the lectures that have been
delivered here during the last two days from this category, because
they were necessary. But I do venture to suggest to you that we have
now reached almost the end of our resources in speech-making, and it
is not enough that our ears are feasted, that our eyes are feasted, but it
is necessary that our hearts have got to be touched and that our hands
and feet have got to be moved. We have been told during the last two
days how necessary it is, if we are to retain our hold upon the
simplicity of Indian character, that our hands and feet should move in
unison with our hearts. But this is only by way of preface, I wanted to
say it is a matter of deep humiliation and shame for us that I am
compelled this evening under the shadow of this great college, in this
sacred city, to address my countrymen in a language that is foreign to
me. I know that if I was appointed an examiner to examine all those
who have been attending during these two days this series of lectures
most of those who might be examined upon these lectures would fail.
And why? Because they have not been touched. I was present at the
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

149

sessions of the great Congress in the month of December. There was a
much vaster audience, and will you believe me when I tell you that the
only speeches that touched that huge audience in Bombay were the
speeches that were delivered in Hindustani? In Bombay, mind you, not
in Benares where everybody speaks Hindi. But between the
vernaculars of the Bombay Presidency on the one hand; and Hindi on
the other, no such great dividing line exists as there does between
English and the sister-languages of India; and the Congress audience
was better able to follow the speakers in Hindi. I am hoping that this
University will see to it that the youths who come to it will receive their
instruction through the medium of their vernaculars. Our language is
the reflection of ourselves, and if you tell me that our languages are
too poor to express the best thought, then I say that the sooner we are
wiped out of existence, the better for us. Is there a man who dreams
that English can ever become the national language of India? (Cries
of “Never”.) Why this handicap on the nation? Just consider for one
moment what an unequal race our lads have to run with every English
lad. I had the privilege of a close conversation with some Poona
professors. They assured me that every Indian youth, because he
reached his knowledge through the English language, lost at least six
precious years of life. Multiply that by the number of students turned
out by our schools and colleges and find out for yourselves how
many thousand years have been lost to the nation. The charge against
us is, that we have no initiative. How can we have any if we are to
devote the precious years of our life to themastery of a foreign
tongue? We fail in this attempt also. Was it possible for any speaker
yesterday and today to impress his audience as was possible for Mr.
Higginbotham? It was not the fault of the previous speakers that they
could not engage the audience. They had more than substance
enough for us in their addresses. But their addresses could not go
home to us. I have heard it said that after all it is English-educated
India which is leading and which is doing all the things for the nation.
It would be monstrous if it were otherwise. The only education we
receive is English education. Surely we must show something for it.
But suppose that we had been receiving during the past fifty years
education through our vernaculars, what should we have had today?
We should have today a free India, we should have our educated men,
150

not as if they were foreigners in their own land but speaking to the
heart of the nation; they would be working amongst the poorest of the
poor, and whatever they would have gained during the past 50 years
would be a heritage for the nation. (Applause.) Today even our wives
are not the sharers in our best thought. Look at Professor Bose 1 and
Professor Ray2 and their brilliant researches. Is it not a shame that
their researches are not the common property of the masses?
Let us now turn to another subject.
The Congress has passed a resolution about self-government
and I have no doubt that the All-India Congress Committee and the
Moslem League will do their duty and come forward with some
tangible suggestions. But I, for one, must frankly confess that I am not
so much interested in what they will be able to produce as I am
interested in anything that the student world is going to produce or
the masses are going to produce. No paper contribution will ever give
us self-government. No amount of speeches will ever make us fit for
self-government. It is only our conduct that will fit us for it.
(Applause.) And how are we trying to govern ourselves? I want to
think audibly this evening. I do not want to make a speech and if you
find me this evening speaking without reserve, pray, consider that you
are only sharing the thoughts of a man who allows himself to think
audibly, and if you think that I seem to transgress the limits that
courtesy imposes upon me, pardon me for the liberty I may be taking.
I visited the Viswanath Temple last evening and as I was walking
through those lanes, these were the thoughts that touched me. If a
stranger dropped from above on to this great temple and he had to
consider what we as Hindus were, would he not be justified in
condemning us? Is not this great temple a reflection of our own
character? I speak feelingly as a Hindu. Is it right that the lanes of our
sacred temple should be as dirty as they are? The houses round about
are built anyhow. The lanes are tortuous and narrow. If even our
temples are not models of roominess and cleanliness, what can our
self-government be? Shall our temples be abodes of holiness,
cleanliness and peace as soon as the English have retired from India,
either of their own pleasure or by compulsion, bag and baggage?
I entirely agree with the President of the Congress that before we
think of self-government, we shall have to do the necessary plodding.
In every city there are two divisions, the cantonment and the city
proper. The city mostly is a stinking den. But we are a people unused

to city life. But if we want city life, we cannot reproduce the
easy-going hamlet life. It is not comforting to think that people walk
about the streets of Indian Bombay under the perpetual fear of
dwellers in the storeyed buildings spitting upon them. I do a great
deal of railway travelling. I observe the difficulty of third-class
passengers. But the Railway Administration is by no means to blame
for all their hard lot. We do not know the elementary laws of
cleanliness. We spit anywhere on the carriage floor, irrespective of the
thought that it is often used as sleeping space. We do not trouble
ourselves as to how we use it; the result is indescribable filth in the
compartment. The so-called better class passengers over-awe their less
fortunate brethren. Among them I have seen the student world also.
Sometimes they behave no better. They can speak English and they
have worn Norfolk Jackets and therefore claim the right to force their
way in and command seating accommodation. I have turned the
searchlight all over and as you have given me the privilege of
speaking to you, I am laying my heart bare. Surely we must set these
things right in our progress towards self-government. I now introduce
you to another scene. His Highness the Maharajah, who presided
yesterday over our deliberations, spoke about the poverty of India.
Other speakers laid great stress upon it. But what did we witness in the
great pandalin which the foundation ceremony was performed by the
Viceroy? Certainly a most gorgeous show, an exhibition of jewellery
which made a splendid feast for the eyes of the greatest jeweller who
chose to come from Paris. I compare with the richly bedecked
noblemen the millions of the poor. And I feel like saying to these
noblemen: “Thereis no salvation for India unless you strip yourselves
of this jewellery and hold it in trust for your countrymen in India.”
(“Hear, hear” and applause.) I am sure it is not the desire of the
King-Emperor or Lord Hardinge that in order to show the truest
loyalty to our King-Emperor, it is necessary for us to ransack our
jewellery-boxes and to appear bedecked from top to toe. I would
undertake at the peril of my life to bring to you a message from King
George himself that he expects nothing of the kind. Sir, whenever I
hear of a great palace rising in any great city of India, be it in British
India or be it in India which is ruled by our great chiefs, I become
jealous at once and I say: “Oh, it is the money that has come from the
agriculturists.” Over 75 per cent of the population are agriculturists
and Mr. Higginbotham told us last night in his own felicitous
language that they are the men who grow two blades of grass in the
place of one. But there cannot be much spirit of self-government
about us if we take away or allow others to take away from them
almost the whole of the results of their labour. Our salvation can only

come through the farmer. Neither the lawyers, nor the doctors, nor the
rich landlords are going to secure it.
Now, last but not the least, it is my bounden duty to refer to what
agitated our minds during these two or three days. All of us have had
many anxious moments while the Viceroy was going through the
streets of Benares. There were detectives stationed in many places. We
were horrified. We asked ourselves: “Why this distrust? Is it not better
that even Lord Hardinge should die than live a living death?” But a
representative of a mighty Sovereign may not. He might find it
necessary even to live a living death. But why was it necessary to
impose these detectives on us? We may foam, we may fret, we may
resent but let us not forget that India of today in her impatience has
produced an army of anarchists. I myself am an anarchist, but of
another type. But there is a class of anarchists amongst us, and if I was
able to reach this class, I would say to them that their anarchism has
no room in India if India is to conquer the conqueror. It is a sign of
fear. If we trust and fear God, we shall have to fear no one, not
Maharajahs, not Viceroys, not the detectives, not even King George. I
honour the anarchist for his love of the country. I honour him for his
bravery in being willing to die for his country; but I ask him: Is
killing honourable? Is the dagger of an assassin a fit precursor of an
honourable death? I deny it. There is no warrant for such methods in
any scriptures. If I found it necessary for the salvation of India that
the English should retire, that they should be driven out, I would not
hesitate to declare that they would have to go, and I hope I would be
prepared to die in defence of that belief. That would, in my opinion,
be an honourable death. The bomb-thrower creates secret plots, is
afraid to come into the open, and when caught pays the penalty of
misdirected zeal. I have been told: “Had we not done this, had some
people not thrown bombs, we should never have gained what we have
got with reference to the partition movement1 .” (Mrs. Besant: “Please
stop it.”) This was what I said2 in Bengal when Mr. Lyons presided at
the meeting. I think what I am saying is necessary. If I am told to stop,
I shall obey. (Turning to the Chairman) I await your orders. If you
consider that by my speaking as I am, I am not serving the country
and the Empire, I shall certainly stop. (Cries of “Go on”.) (The

Chairman: “Please explain your object.”) I am explaining my object.
1 am simply (Another interruption.) My friends, please do not resent
this interruption. If Mrs. Besant this evening suggests that I should
stop, she does so because she loves India so well, and she considers
that I am erring in thinking audibly before you young men. But even
so, I simply say this that I want to purge India of the atmosphere of
suspicion on either side; if we are to reach our goal, we should have an
empire which is to be based upon mutual love and mutual trust. Is it
not better that we talk under the shadow of this college than that we
should be talking irresponsibly in our homes? I consider that it is
much better that we talk these things openly. I have done so with
excellent results before now. I know that there is nothing that the
students are not discussing. There is nothing that the students do not
know. I am therefore turning the searchlight towards ourselves. I hold
the name of my country so dear to me that I exchange these thoughts
with you and submit to you that there is no reason for anarchism in
India. Let us frankly and openly say whatever we want to say to our
rulers and face the consequences if what we have to say does not
please them. But let us not abuse. I was talking the other day to a
member of the much-abused Civil Service. I have not very much in
common with the members of that Service, but I could not help
admiring the manner in which he was speaking to me. He said: “Mr.
Gandhi, do you for one moment suppose that all we, Civil Servants,
are a bad lot, that we want to oppress the people whom we have come
to govern?” “No”, I said. “Then, if you get an opportunity, put in a
word for the much-abused Civil Service.”, And I am here to put in
that word. Yes, many members of the Indian Civil Service are most
decidedly overbearing, they are tyrannical, at times thoughtless. Many
other adjectives may be used. I grant all these things and I grant also
that after having lived in India for a certain number of years, some of
them become somewhat degraded. But what does that signify? They
were gentlemen before they came here, and if they have lost some of
the moral fibre, it is a reflection upon ourselves. (Cries of “No”.) Just
think out for yourselves, if a man who was good yesterday has
become bad after having come in contact with me, is he responsible
that he has deteriorated or am I? The atmosphere of sycophancy and
falsity that surrounds them on their coming to India demoralises them
as it would many of us. It is well to take the blame sometimes. If we
are to receive self-government, we shall have to take it. We shall never
be granted self-government. Look at the history of the British Empire
154

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

and the British nation; freedom loving as it is, it will not be a party to
give freedom to a people who will not take it themselves. Learn your
lesson if you wish to from the Boer War. Those who were enemies of
that Empire only a few years ago have now become friends.
[At this point there was an interruption and there was a movement on the
platform to leave; the speech therefore ended here abruptly.]

124. EXTRACT FROM LETTER TO
MAHARAJA OF DARBHANGA1
February 7, 1916
Speaking last night at one of the lectures inaugurated in connection with the
University week in Benares, Mr. Gandhi referred to the precautions taken by the
authorities to protect the Viceroy while he was in Benares. Mr. Gandhi was asked to
explain briefly what he was about to say. Eventually all the princes present left
in a body, and, though Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya2 explained that what
Mr. Gandhi meant was that it was a shame to themselves that such a course was
thought necessary because of the misdeeds of a few misguided youths, the meeting
dispersed at once.
Mr. Gandhi, today, wrote a letter of explanation to the Maharaja of
Darbhanga3 in which, after expressing his regret at last night’s incident, he says:

My sole object in referring to the Viceregal visit was to express
the very strong views I hold against all acts of violence and so-called
anarchy. In common with most of us, I felt deeply humiliated that
extraordinary precautions should have been rendered necessary for
the protection of the person of one of the noblest of Viceroys when
he was, in a special sense, our honoured guest in this sacred city. My
mission in life is to preach and assist in securing the utmost freedom
for my country but never by violence to the person of any human
being, even under the greatest provocation. My speech was conceived

The Maharaja of Darbhanga, who presided at the morning lectures today, at
which almost all the princes now in Benares were present, made a brief reference to
last night’s incident. He observed that they had heard with grief and pain the remarks
of Mr. Gandhi and he was sure they all disapproved the attitude Mr. Gandhi had taken
up. (Voices: “We all disapprove.”)

126. INTERVIEW TO A.P.I. ON BENARES ‘INCIDENT’
February 9, 1916
Mr. Gandhi, who arrived in Bombay yesterday afternoon from Benares, being
interviewed about the incident which interrupted his speech at Benares, said that he
was unable to say what particular remarks of his were objected to, nor did Mrs. Besant
point out any such remarks. She only appealed to the Chairman to stop him. Mr.
Gandhi said his speech that evening was practically a repetition, in so far as it related
to anarchism, of what he had said1 at the Calcutta meeting last year of which the Hon.
Mr. Lyons was Chairman. At this point, the audience wanted the speaker to go on, but
Mr. Gandhi said that he would not do so unless he received the Chairman’s permission
to continue. He also asked the audience not to resent, as it was inclined, Mrs.
Besant’s interruption, as anybody who might feel aggrieved against the speaker’s
remarks had a right to ask for a ruling from the Chair.
Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said:

And I proceeded with my speech only after the Maharaja of
Darbhanga’s permission, which he gave after considering the matter
for a while and cautioning me to explain matters briefly. I proceeded,
but still noticed a stir on the platform, and that Mrs. Besant was
whispering to the Princes who were sitting near her that I was neither
withdrawing nor explaining and saying that they ought not to stay. 2
The next thing I observed was that the Princes rose one after another
and as the Chairman also left, I could not finish my speech.
In reply to a question whether he would like to withdraw any of the remarks he
had made at the meeting, Mr. Gandhi emphatically declared that every word was
well-considered and well-weighed. Continuing, he said:

That I could ever endorse methods of violence is unthinkable. I
was not eager to speak at all. I did so under great pressure from
friends, as I was credited with having some influence over the student
population of the country. I was asked to speak about the violence
which has unfortunately been the creed of some impulsive youths,
owing to which we had to witness the humiliating spectacle of
extraordinary precautions having to be taken for the protection of the

life of our honoured guest from ourselves. Throughout the whole of
my remarks, there was not a word of endorsement of violent deeds. I
did give the misguided youths credit for patriotic motives, but I
showed that the action was all the worthier of condemnation, in that it
did irreparable harm in the long run. In fact, the whole of my speech
was intended to direct the searchlight towards ourselves and to show
that for many of our difficulties, we were alone responsible. It is my
firm belief that, but for Mrs. Besant’s hasty and ill-conceived
interruption, nothing would have happened and my speech in its
completed state would have left no room for any doubt as to my
meaning.
Questioned as to whether it was a fact that the Hon. Pandit Madan Mohan
Malaviya apologised to the meeting after the incident had occurred, Mr. Gandhi
replied:

Mr. Malaviya did address the meeting. But I could trace no
apology in his remarks. He merely said that I had spoken at his
special request and my sole intention was to show how suicidal
methods of violence were.

127. SPEECH ON SWADESHI AT MISSIONARY CONFERENCE,
MADRAS1
February 14, 1916
It was not without much diffidence that I undertook to speak to
you at all. And I was hard put to it in the selection of my subject. I
have chosen a very delicate and difficult subject. It is delicate because
of the peculiar views I hold upon swadeshi, and it is difficult because I
have not that command of language which is necessary for giving
adequate expression to my thoughts. I know that I may rely upon
your indulgence for the many shortcomings you will no doubt find in
my address, the more so when I tell you that there is nothing in what I
am about to say, that I am not either already practising or am not
preparing to practise to the best of my ability. It encourages me to
observe that last month you devoted a week to prayer in the place of
an address. I have earnestly prayed that what I am about to say may
bear fruit and I know that you will bless my words with a similar
1

Text of the paper read by Gandhiji. It was reprinted In Young India 21-6-1919
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

prayer.
After much thinking, I have arrived at a definition of swadeshi
that perhaps best illustrates my meaning. Swadeshi is that spirit in us
which restricts us to the use and service of our immediate
surroundings to the exclusion of the more remote. Thus, as for
religion, in order to satisfy the requirements of the definition, I must
restrict myself to my ancestral religion. That is the use of my
immediate religious surroundings. If I find it defective, I should serve
it by purging it of its defects. In the domain of politics, I should make
use of the indigenous institutions and serve them by curing them of
their proved defects. In that of economics, I should use only things
that are produced by my immediate neighbours and serve those
industries by making them efficient and complete where they might
be found wanting. It is suggested that such swadeshi, if reduced to
practice, will lead to the millennium. And as we do not abandon our
pursuit after the millennium because we do not expect quite to reach it
within our time, so may we not abandon swadeshi even though it may
not be fully attained for generations to come.
Let us briefly examine three branches of Swadeshi as sketched
above. Hinduism has become a conservative religion and therefore a
mighty force because of the Swadeshi spirit underlying it. It is the
most tolerant because it is non-proselytising, and it is as capable of
expansion today as it has been found to be in the past. It has
succeeded not in driving, as I think it has been erroneously held, but
in absorbing Buddhism. By reason of the swadeshi spirit, a Hindu
refuses to change his religion not necessarily because he considers it
to be the best, but because he knows that he can complement it by
introducing reforms. And what I have said about Hinduism is, I
suppose, true of the other great faiths of the world, only it is held that
it is specially so in the case of Hinduism. But here comes the point I
am labouring to reach. If there is any substance in what I have said,
will not the great missionary bodies of India, to whom she owes a deep
debt of gratitude for what they have done and are doing, do still better
and serve the spirit of Christianity better, by dropping the goal of
proselytising but continuing their philanthropic work? I hope you will
not consider this to be an impertinence on my part. I make the
suggestion in all sincerity and with due humility. Moreover, I have
some claim upon your attention. I have endeavoured to study the
Bible. I consider it as part of my scriptures. The spirit of the Sermon
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

159

on the Mount competes almost on equal terms with the Bhagavad
Gita for the domination of my heart. I yield to no Christian in the
strength of devotion with which I sing, “Lead, kindly Light” and
several other inspired hymns of a similar nature. I have come under
the influence of noted Christian missionaries belonging to different
denominations. And I enjoy to this day the privilege of friendship
with some of them. You will perhaps therefore allow that I have
offered the above suggestion not as a biased Hindu but as a humble
and impartial student of religion with great leanings towards
Christianity. May it not be that the “Go Ye unto All the World”
message has been somewhat narrowly interpreted and the spirit of it
missed? It will not be denied, I speak from experience, that many of
the conversions are only so called. In some cases, the appeal has gone
not to the heart but to the stomach. And in every case, a conversion
leaves a sore behind it which, I venture to think, is avoidable. Quoting
again from experience, a new birth, a change of heart, is perfectly
possible in every one of the great faiths. I know I am now treading
upon thin ice. But I do not apologise, in closing this part of my
subject, for saving that the frightful outrage that is just going on in
Europe, perhaps, shows that the message of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son
of Peace, has been little understood in Europe, and that light upon it
may have to be thrown from the East.
I have sought your help in religious matters, which it is yours to
give in a special sense. But I make bold to seek it even in political
matters. I do not believe that religion has nothing to do with politics.
The latter divorced from religion is like a corpse only fit to be buried.
As a matter of fact, in your own silent manner, you influence politics
not a little. And I feel that if the attempt to separate politics from
religion had not been made, as it is even now made, they would not
have degenerated, as they often appear to do. No one considers that
the political life of the country is in a happy state. Following out the
swadeshi spirit, I observe the indigenous institutions and the village
panchayats hold me. India is really a republican country, and it is
because it is that that it has survived every shock hitherto delivered.
Princes and potentates, whether they were Indian-born or foreigners,
have hardly touched the vast masses except for collecting revenue.
The latter in their turn seem to have rendered unto Caesar what was
Caesar’s and for the rest have done much as they have liked. The vast
organisation of caste answered not only the religious wants of the
community, but it answered too its political needs. The villagers
160

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

managed their internal affairs through the caste system, and through it
they dealt with any oppression from the ruling power or powers. It is
not possible to deny of a nation that was capable of producing the
caste system its wonderful power of organisation. One had but to
attend the great Kumbha Mela at Hardwar last year to know how
skilful that organisation must have been, which without any seeming
effort, was able effectively to cater for more than a million pilgrims.
Yet is it the fashion to say that we lack organising ability. This is true, I
fear, to a certain extent, of those who have been nurtured in the new
traditions. We have laboured under a terrible handicap owing to an
almost fatal departure from the swadeshi spirit. We the educated
classes have received our education through a foreign tongue. We
have therefore not reacted upon the masses. We want to represent the
masses, but we fail. They recognise us not much more than they
recognise the English officers. Their hearts are an open book to
neither. Their aspirations are not ours. Hence there is a break. And
you witness not in reality failure to organise, but want of
correspondence between the representatives and the represented. If
during the last fifty years we had been educated through the
vernaculars,
our
elders
and
our
servants
and
our
neighbours would have partaken of our knowledge; the discoveries of
a Bose or a Ray would have been household treasure as are the
Ramayan and the Mahabharat. As it is, so far as the masses are
concerned, those great discoveries might as well have been made by
foreigners. Had instruction in all the branches of learning been given
through the vernaculars, I make bold to say that they would have been
enriched wonderfully. The question of village sanitation, etc., would
have been solved long ago. The village panchayats would be now a
living force in a special way, and India would almost be enjoying
self-government suited to its requirements and would have been
spared the humiliating spectacle of organised assassination on its
sacred soil. It is not too late to mend. And you can help if you will, as
no other body or bodies can.
And now for the last division of swadeshi. Much of the deep
poverty of the masses is due to the ruinous departure from swadeshi in
the economic and industrial life. If not an article of commerce had
been brought from outside India, she would be today a land flowing
with milk and honey. But that was not to be. We were greedy and so
was England. The connection between England and India was based
clearly upon an error. But she (England) does not remain in India in
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

161

error. It is her declared policy that India is to be held in trust for her
people. If this be true, Lancashire must stand aside. And if the
swadeshi doctrine is a sound doctrine, Lancashire can stand aside
without hurt, though it may sustain a shock for the time being. I think
of swadeshi not as a boycott movement undertaken by way of
revenge. I conceive it as a religious principle to be followed by all. I
am no economist, but I have read some treatises which show that
England could easily become a self-sustained country, growing all the
produce she needs. This may be an utterly ridiculous proposition, and
perhaps the best proof that it cannot be true is that England is one of
the largest importers in the world. But India cannot live for Lancashire
or any other country before she is able to live for herself. And she can
live for herself only if she produces and is helped to produce
everything for her requirements within her own borders. She need not
be, she ought not to be, drawn into the vortex of mad and ruinous
competition which breeds fratricide, jealousy and many other evils.
But who is to stop her great millionaires from entering into the world
competition? Certainly, not legislation. Force of public opinion,
proper education, however, can do a great deal in the desired
direction. The handloom industry is in a dying condition. I took
special care during my wanderings last year to see as many weavers as
possible, and my heart ached to find how they had lost, how families
had retired from this once-flourishing and honourable occupation. If
we follow the swadeshi doctrine, it would be your duty and mine to
find out neighbours who can supply our wants and to teach them to
supply them where they do not know how to, assuming that there are
neighbours who are in want of healthy occupation. Then every village
of India will almost be a self-supporting and self-contained unit
exchanging only such necessary commodities with other villages
where they are not locally producible. This may all sound
nonsensical. Well, India is a country of nonsense. It is nonsensical to
parch one’s throat with thirst when a kindly Mahomedan is ready to
offer pure water to drink. And yet thousands of Hindus would rather
die of thirst than drink water from a Mahomedan household. These
nonsensical men can also, once they are convinced that their religion
demands that they should wear garments manufactured in India only
and eat food only grown in India, decline to wear any other clothing
or eat any other food. Lord Curzon set the fashion for tea-drinking.
And that pernicious drug now bids fair to overwhelm the nation. It has
already undermined the digestive apparatus of hundreds of thousands
162

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

of men and women and constitutes an additional tax upon their
slender purses. Lord Hardinge can set the fashion for swadeshi and
almost the whole of India will foreswear foreign goods. There is a
verse in the Bhagavad Gita, which, freely rendered, means masses
follow the classes. It is easy to undo the evil if the thinking portion of
the community were to take the swadeshi vow even though it may for
a time cause considerable inconvenience. I hate interference in any
department of life. At best, it is the lesser evil. But I would tolerate,
welcome, indeed plead for, stiff protective duty upon foreign goods.
Natal, a British colony, protected its sugar by taxing the sugar that
came from another British colony, Mauritius. England has sinned
against India by forcing free trade upon her. It may have been food
for her, but it has been poison for this country.
It has often been urged that India cannot adopt swadeshi in
the economic life at any rate. Those who advance this objection do
not look upon swadeshi as a rule of life. With them, it is a mere
patriotic effort not to be made if it involved any self-denial. Swadeshi,
as defined here, is a religious discipline to be undergone in utter
disregard of the physical discomfort it may cause to individuals.
Under its spell, the deprivation of pin or a needle, because these are
not manufactured in India need cause no terror. A swadeshi will learn
to do without hundreds of things which today he considers necessary.
Moreover, those who dismiss swadeshi from their minds by arguing
the impossible forget that swadeshi, after all, is a goal to be reached by
steady effort. And we would be making for the goal even if we
confined swadeshi to a given set of articles, allowing ourselves as a
temporary measure to use such things as might not be procurable in
the country.
There now remains for me to consider one more objection that
has been raised against swadeshi. The objectors consider it to be a
most selfish doctrine without any warrant in the civilized code of
morality. With them, to practise Swadeshi is to revert to barbarism. I
cannot enter into a detailed analysis of the proposition. But I would
urge that Swadeshi is the only doctrine consistent with the law of
humility and love. It is arrogance to think of launching out to serve
the whole of India when I am hardly able to serve even my own
family. It were better to concentrate my effort upon the family and
consider that through them I was serving the whole nation and, if you
will, the whole of humanity. This is humility and it is love. The motive
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

163

will determine the quality of the act. I may serve my family regardless
of the sufferings I may cause to others, as, for instance, I may accept
an employment which enables me to extort money from people. I
enrich myself thereby and then satisfy many unlawful demands of the
family. Here I am neither serving the family nor the State. Or I may
recognise that God has given me hands and feet only to work with for
my sustenance and for that of those who may be dependent upon me.
I would then at once simplify my life and that of those whom I can
directly reach. In this instance, I would have served the family without
causing injury to anyone else. Supposing that everyone followed this
mode of life, we would have at once an ideal State. All will not reach
that state at the same time. But those of us who, realising its truth,
enforce it in practice will clearly anticipate and accelerate the coming
of that happy day. Under this plan of life, in seeming to serve India to
the exclusion of every other country, I do not harm any other
country. My patriotism is both exclusive and inclusive. It is exclusive
in the sense that in all humility I confine my attention to the land of
my birth, but it is inclusive in the sense that my service is not of a
competitive or antagonistic nature. Sic utere tuo ut alienum non
laedas1 is not merely a legal maxim, but it is a grand doctrine of life.
It is the key to a proper practice of ahimsa or love. It is for you, the
custodians of a great faith, to set the fashion and show by your
preaching, sanctified by practice, that patriotism based on hatred
“killeth” and that patriotism based on love “giveth life”.

128. SPEECH ON ‘ASHRAM VOWS’ AT Y. M. C. A., MADRAS1
February 16, 1916
MR. CHAIRMAN AND DEAR FRIENDS,

I have so often said that I am not myself fond of hearing my
own voice and I assure you that this morning also I retained the same
position. It was only, if you will believe me, my great regard for the
students, whom I love, whom I respect and who I consider are the
hope of future India that moved me to accept this invitation to speak
to you this morning. I did not know what subject to choose. A friend
has handed me a slip here asking me whether I would enlighten the
students on the Benares incident. (“Hear, hear”.) I fear I shall have to
disappoint that friend and those of you who associate yourselves with
that view. I don’t think that you need lay any stress upon that
incident. These are the passing waves which will always come and go.
I should therefore this morning fear rather if I can possibly do so and
pour my soul out to you with reference to something which I treasure
so much above everything else.2
To many of the students who came here last year to converse
with me, I said3 I was about to establish an institution—an Ashram—
somewhere in India, and it is about that place that I am going to talk
to you this morning. I feel and I have felt during the whole of my
public life that what we need, what any nation needs, but we perhaps
of all the nations of the world need just now, is nothing else and
nothing less than character-building. And this is the view propounded
by that great patriot, Mr. Gokhale. (Cheers.) As you know, in many of
his speeches, he used to say that we would get nothing, we would
deserve nothing unless we had character to back what we wished for.

And as you know, in the prospectus that has been issued in connection
with the Society, Mr. Gokhale has deliberately stated that it was
necessary to spiritualise the political life of the country. You know
also that he used to say so often that our average was less than the
average of so many European nations. I do not know whether that
statement by him, whom, with pride, I consider to be my political
guru, has really foundation in fact, but I do believe that there is much
to be said to justify it in so far as educated India is concerned ; not
because we, the educated portion of the community, have blundered,
but because we have been creatures of circumstances. Be that as it
may, this is the maxim of life which I have accepted, namely, that no
work done by any man, no matter how great he is, will really prosper
unless he1 has a religious backing. But what is religion? the question
will be immediately asked. I, for one, would answer, not the religion
which you will get after reading all the scriptures of the world; it is not
really a grasp by the brain, but it is a heart-grasp. It is a thing which is
not alien to us, but it is a thing which has to be evolved out of us. It is
always within us, with some consciously so; with others, quite
unconsciously. But it is there; and whether we wake up this religious
instinct in us through outside assistance or by inward growth, no
matter how it is done, it has got to be done if we want to do anything
in the right manner and anything that is going to persist.
Our scriptures have laid down certain rules as maxims of life
and as axioms which we have to take for granted as self-demonstrated
truths. The shastras tell us that without living according to those
maxims, we are incapable even of having a reasonable perception of
religion. Believing in these implicitly for all these long years and
having actually endeavoured to reduce to practice these injunctions of
the shastras, I have deemed it necessary to seek the association of
those who think with me in founding this institution. And I shall
venture this morning to place before you the rules that have been
drawn up and that have to be observed by everyone who seeks to be a
member of that Ashram.
Five of these are known as Yamas, and the first and the foremost
is, the

VOW OF TRUTH

Not truth simply as we ordinarily understand it, that as far as
possible we ought not to resort to a lie, that is to say, not truth which
merely answers the saying, “Honesty is the best policy”— implying
that if it is not the best policy, we may depart from it. But here Truth,
as it is conceived, means that we have to rule our life by this law of
Truth at any cost. And in order to satisfy the definition, I have drawn
upon the celebrated illustration of the life of Prahlad1 . For the sake of
Truth, he dared to oppose his own father, and he defended himself,
not by retaliation by paying his father back in his own coin, but in
defence of Truth, as he knew it, he was prepared to die without caring
to return the blows that he had received from his father or from those
who were charged with his father’s instructions. Not only that: he
would not in any way even parry the blows. On the contrary, with a
smile on his lips, he underwent the innumerable tortures to which he
was subjected, with the result that at last, Truth rose triumphant, not
that Prahlad suffered the tortures because he knew that some day or
other in his very life-time he would be able to demonstrate the
infallibility of the law of Truth. That fact was there; but if he had died
in the midst of torture, he would still have adhered to Truth. That is
the Truth that I would like us to follow. There was an incident I
noticed yesterday. It was a trifling incident, but I think these trifling
incidents are like straws which show which way the wind is blowing.
The incident was this: I was talking to a friend who wanted to talk to
me aside, and we were engaged in a private conversation. A third
friend dropped in and he politely asked whether he was intruding.
The friend to whom I was talking said: “Oh, no, there is nothing
private here.” I felt taken-aback a little, because, as I was taken aside, I
knew that so far as this friend was concerned, the conversation was
private. But he immediately, out of politeness, I would call it
over-politeness, said there was no private conversation and that he (the
third friend) could join. I suggest to you that this is a departure from
my definition of Truth. I think that the friend should have, in the
gentlest manner possible, but still openly and frankly, said: “Yes, just
now, as you properly say, you would be intruding” without giving the
slightest offence to the person if he was himself a gentleman—and
we are bound to consider everybody to be a gentleman unless he

proves to be otherwise. But I may be told that the incident, after all,
proves the gentility of the nation. I think that it is over-proving the
case. If we continue to say these things out of politeness, we really
become a nation of hypocrites. I recall a conversation I had with an
English friend. He was comparatively a stranger. He is a Principal of a
College and has been in India for several years. He was comparing
notes with me, and he asked me whether I would admit that we, unlike
most Englishmen, would not dare to say “No” when it was “No”
that we meant. And I must admit that I immediately said “Yes”. I
agree with that statement. We do hesitate to say “No”, frankly and
boldly, when we want to pay due regard to the sentiments of the
person whom we are addressing. In this Ashram, we make it a rule that
we must say “No” when we mean “No”, regardless of consequences.
This, then, is the first rule. Then we come to the
DOCTRINE OF AHIMSA

Literally speaking, ahimsa means non-killing. But to me it has a
world of meaning and takes me into realms much higher, infinitely
higher, than the realm to which I would go, if I merely understood by
ahimsa non-killing. Ahimsa really means that you may not offend
anybody, you may not harbour an uncharitable thought even in
connection with one who may consider himself to be your enemy.
Pray notice the guarded nature of this thought; I do not say “whom
you consider to be your enemy”, but “who may consider himself to
be your enemy”. For one who follows the doctrine of ahimsa, there is
no room for an enemy; he denies the existence of an enemy. But
there are people who consider themselves to be his enemies, and he
cannot help that circumstance. So, it is held that we may not harbour
an evil thought even in connection with such persons. If we return
blow for blow, we depart from the doctrine of ahimsa. But I go
further. If we resent a friend’s action or the so-called enemy’s action,
we still fall short of this doctrine. But when I say we should not resent,
I do not say that we should acquiesce; but by resenting I mean
wishing that some harm should be done to the enemy, or that he
should be put out of the way, not even by any action of ours, but by
the action of somebody else, or, say, by Divine agency. If we harbour
even this thought, we depart from this doctrine of ahimsa. Those who
join the Ashram have to literally accept that meaning. That does not
mean that we practise that doctrine in its entirety. Far from it. It is an
ideal which we have to reach, and it is an ideal to be reached even at
168

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

this very moment, if we are capable of doing so. But it is not a
proposition in geometry to be learnt by heart: it is not even like
solving difficult problems in higher mathematics; it is infinitely more
difficult than solving those problems. Many of you have burnt the
midnight oil in solving those problems. If you want to follow out this
doctrine, you will have to do much more than burn the midnight oil.
You will have to pass many a sleepless night, and go through many a
mental torture and agony before you can reach, before you can even
be within measurable distance of this goal. It is the goal, and nothing
less than that, you and I have to reach if we want to understand what a
religious life means. I will not say much more on this doctrine than
this: that a man who believes in the efficacy of this doctrine finds in
the ultimate stage, when he is about to reach the goal, the whole world
at his feet, not that he wants the whole world at his feet, but it must be
so. If you express your love—ahimsa—in such a manner that it
impresses itself indelibly upon your so-called enemy, he must return
that love. Another thought which comes out of this is that, under this
rule, there is no room for organised assassinations, and there is no
room for murders even openly committed, and there is no room for
any violence even for the sake of your country, and even for guarding
the honour of precious ones that may be under your charge. After all,
that would be a poor defence of honour. This doctrine of ahimsa tells
us that we may guard the honour of those who are under our charge
by delivering ourselves into the hands of the man who would commit
the sacrilege. And that requires far greater physical and mental
courage than the delivering of blows. You may have some degree of
physical power—I do not say courage—and you may use that power.
But after that is expended, what happens? The other man is filled with
wrath and indignation, and you have made him more angry by
matching your violence against his; and when he has done you to
death, the rest of his violence is delivered against your charge. But if
you do not retaliate, but stand your ground, between your charge and
the opponent, simply receiving the blows without retaliating, what
happens? I give you my promise that the whole of the violence will be
expended on you, and your charge will be left unscathed. Under this
plan of life, there is no conception of patriotism which justifies such
wars as you witness today in Europe. Then there is the
VOW OF C ELIBACY

Those who want to perform national service, or those who want
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

169

to have a glimpse of the real religious life, must lead a celibate life, no
matter if married or unmarried. Marriage but brings a woman closer
together [sic] with the man, and they become friends in a special
sense, never to be parted either in this life or in the lives that are to
come. But I do not think that, in our conception of marriage, our lusts
should necessarily enter. Be that as it may, this is what is placed before
those who come to the Ashram. I do not deal with that at any length.
Then we have the
VOW OF C ONTROL OF THE P ALATE

A man who wants to control his animal passions easily does so if
he control his palate. I fear this is one of the most difficult vows to
follow. I am just now coming after having inspected the Victoria
Hostel. I saw there, not to my dismay, though it should be to my
dismay, but I am used to it now, that there are so many kitchens, not
kitchens that are established in order to serve caste restrictions, but
kitchens that have become necessary in order that people can have the
condiments, and the exact weight of the condiments, to which they are
used in the respective places from which they come. And therefore we
find that for the Brahmins themselves there are different compartments and different kitchens catering for the delicate tastes of all these
different groups, I suggest to you that this is simply slavery to the
palate, rather than mastery over it. I may say this: Unless we take our
minds off from this habit, and unless we shut our eyes to the tea shops
and coffee shops and all these kitchens, and unless we are satisfied
with foods that are necessary for the proper maintenance of our
physical health, and unless we are prepared to rid ourselves of
stimulating, heating and exciting condiments that we mix with our
food, we will certainly not be able to control the overabundant,
unnecessary, exciting stimulation that we may have. If we do not do
that, the result naturally is, that we abuse ourselves and we abuse even
the sacred trust given to us, and we become less than animals and
brutes. Eating, drinking and indulging passions we share in common
with the animals, but have you ever seen a horse or a cow indulging in
the abuse of the palate as we do? Do you suppose that it is a sign of
civilization, a sign of real life that we should multiply our eatables so
far that we do not even know where we are; and seek; dish after dish
until at last we have become absolutely mad and run after the
newspaper sheets which give us advertisements about these dishes?
Then we have the
170

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

VOW OF NON -THIEVING

I suggest that we are thieves in a way. If I take anything that I do
not need for my own immediate use, and keep it, I thieve it from
somebody else. I venture to suggest that it is the fundamental law of
Nature, without exception, that Nature produces enough for our wants
from day to day, and if only everybody took enough for himself and
nothing more, there would be no pauperism in this world, there would
be no man dying of starvation in this world. But so long as we have
got this inequality, so long we are thieving. I am no socialist and I do
not want to dispossess those who have got possessions; but I do say
that, personally, those of us who want to see light out of darkness have
to follow the rule. I do not want to dispossess anybody. I should then
be departing from the rule of ahimsa. If somebody else possesses
more than I do, let him. But so far as my own life has to be regulated,
I do say that I dare not possess anything which I do not want. In India
we have got three millions of people having to be satisfied with one
meal a day, and that meal consisting of a chapati containing no fat in
it, and a pinch of salt. You and I have no right to anything that we
really have until these three million are clothed and fed better. You
and I, who ought to know better, must adjust our wants, and even
undergo voluntary starvation in order that they may be nursed, fed
and clothed. Then there is the vow of non-possession which follows as
a matter of course. Then I go to the
VOW OF S WADESHI

The vow of swadeshi is a necessary vow. But you are conversant
with the swadeshi life and the swadeshi spirit. I suggest to you we are
departing from one of the sacred laws of our being when we leave our
neighbour and go out somewhere else in order to satisfy our wants. If
a man comes from Bombay here and offers you wares, you are not
justified in supporting the Bombay merchant or trader so long as you
have got a merchant at your very door, born and bred in Madras. That
is my view of swadeshi. In your village, so long as you have got your
village-barber, you are bound to support him to the exclusion of the
finished barber who may come to you from Madras. If you find it
necessary that your village-barber should reach the attainment of the
barber from Madras, you may train him to that. Send him to Madras
by all means, if you wish, in order that he may learn his calling. Until
you do that, you are not justified in going to another barber. That is
swadeshi. So, when we find that there are many things that we cannot
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

171

get in India, we must try to do without them. We may have to do
without many things which we may consider necessary, but believe
me, when you have that frame of mind, you will find a great burden
taken off your shoulders, even as the Pilgrim did in that inimitable
book, Pilgrim’s Progress: There came a time when the mighty burden
that the Pilgrim was carrying on his shoulders unconsciously dropped
from him, and he felt a freer man than he was when he started on the
journey. So will you feel freer men than you are now, immediately
you adopt this swadeshi life. We have also the
VOW OF F EARLESSNESS

I found, throughout my wanderings in India, that India,
educated India, is seized with a paralysing fear. We may not open our
lips in public; we may not declare our confirmed opinion in public;
we may hold those opinions; we may talk about them secretly; and we
may do anything we like within the four walls of our house,—but
those are not for public consumption. If we had taken a vow of
silence, I would have nothing to say. When we open our lips in public,
we say things which we do not really believe in. I do not know
whether this is not the experience of almost every public man who
speaks in India. I then suggest to you that there is only one Being, if
Being is the proper term to be used, Whom we have to fear, and that is
God. When we fear God, we shall fear no man, no matter how
high-placed he may be. And if you want to follow the vow of truth in
any shape or form, fearlessness is the necessary consequence. And so
you find, in the Bhagavad Gita, fearlessness is declared as the first
essential quality of a Brahmin. We fear consequences, and therefore
we are afraid to tell the truth. A man who fears God will certainly not
fear any earthly consequence. Before we can aspire to the position of
understanding what religion is, and before we can aspire to the
position of guiding the destinies of India, do you not see that we
should adopt this habit of fearlessness? Or shall we over-awe our
countrymen even as we are over-awed? We thus see how important this
“fearlessness vow” is. And we have also the
VOW R EGARDING THE UNTOUCHABLES

There is an ineffaceable blot that Hinduism today carries with it.
I have declined to believe that it has been handed to us from
immemorial times. I think that this miserable, wretched, enslaving
spirit of “untouchableness” must have come to us when we were in
172

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

the cycle of our lives, at our lowest ebb, and that evil has still stuck to
us and it still remains with us. It is, to my mind, a curse that has come
to us, and as long as that curse remains with us, so long I think we are
bound to consider that every affliction that we labour under in this
sacred land is a fit and proper punishment for this great and indelible
crime that we are committing. That any person should be considered
untouchable because of his calling passes one’s comprehension; and
you, the student world, who receive all this modern education, if you
become a party to this crime, it were better that you received no
education whatsoever.
Of course, we are labouring under a very heavy handicap.
Although you may realise that there cannot be a single human being
on this earth who should be considered to be untouchable, you cannot
react upon your families, you cannot react upon your surroundings,
because all your thought is conceived in a foreign tongue, and all
your energy is devoted to that. And so we have also introduced a rule
in this Ashram that we shall receive our
EDUCATION THROUGH THE VERNACULARS

In Europe, every cultured man learns, not only his language, but
also other languages, certainly three or four. And even as they do in
Europe, in order to solve the problem of language in India, we, in this
Ashram, make it a point to learn as many Indian vernaculars as we
possibly can. And I assure you that the trouble of learning these
languages is nothing compared to the trouble that we have to take in
mastering the English language. We never master the English
language; with some exceptions, it has not been possible for us to do
so; we can never express ourselves as clearly as we can in our own
mother tongue. How dare we rub out of our memory all the years of
our infancy? But that is precisely what we do when we commence our
higher life, as we call it, through the medium of a foreign tongue. This
creates a breach in our life for bridging which we shall have to pay
dearly and heavily. And you will see now the connection between
these two things—education and untouchableness—this persistence of
the spirit of untouchableness even at this time of the day in spite of
the spread of knowledge and education. Education has enabled us to
see the horrible crime. But we are seized with fear also and, therefore,
we cannot take this doctrine to our homes. And we have got a
superstitious veneration for our family traditions and for the members
of our family. You say, “My parents will die if I tell them that I, at
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

173

least, can no longer partake of this crime.” I say that Prahlad never
considered that his father would die if he pronounced the sacred
syllables of the name of Vishnu1 . On the contrary, he made the whole
of that household ring, from one corner to another, by repeating that
name even in the sacred presence of his father. And so you and I may
do this thing in the sacred presence of our parents. If, after receiving
this rude shock, some of them expire, I think that would be no
calamity. It may be that some rude shocks of the kind might have to
be delivered. So long as we persist in these things which have been
handed down to us for generations, these incidents may happen. But
there is a higher law of Nature, and in due obedience to that higher
law, my parents and myself should make that sacrifice, and then we
follow
HAND -WEAVING

You may ask: “Why should we use our hands?” and say “the
manual work has got to be done by those who are illiterate. I can only
occupy myself with reading literature and political essays.” I think
that we have to realise the dignity of labour. If a barber or shoe-maker
attends a college, he ought not to abandon the profession of barber or
shoe-maker. I consider that a barber’s profession is just as good as the
profession of medicine.
Last of all, when you have conformed to these rules, I think
then, and not till then, you may come to
P OLITICS

and dabble in them to your heart’s content, and certainly you will
then never go wrong. Politics, divorced of religion, have absolutely no
meaning. If the student-world crowd the political platforms of this
country, to my mind it is not necessarily a healthy sign of national
growth; but that does not mean that you, in your student-life, ought
not to study politics. Politics are a part of our being; we ought to
understand our national institutions, and we ought to understand our
national growth and all those things. We may do it from our infancy.
So, in our Ashram, every child is taught to understand the political
institutions of our country, and to know how the country is vibrating
with new emotions, with new aspirations, with a new life. But we want
also the steady light, the infallible light, of religious faith, not a faith
1

174

One of the Hindu trinity, regarded as Preserver of the Universe
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

which merely appeals to the intelligence, but a faith which is indelibly
inscribed on the heart. First, we want to realise that religious
consciousness, and immediately we have done that, I think the whole
department of life is open to us,andit should then be a sacred privilege
of students and everybody to partake of that whole life, so that, when
they grow to manhood, and when they leave their colleges, they may
do so as men properly quipped to battle with life. Today what
happens is this: much of the political life is confined to student life;
immediately the students leave their colleges and cease to be students,
they sink into oblivion, they seek miserable employments, carrying
miserable emoluments, rising no higher in their aspirations, knowing
nothing of God, knowing nothing of fresh air or bright light, and
nothing of that real vigorous independence that comes out of
obedience to these laws that I have ventured to place before you.
C ONCLUSION

I am not here asking you to crowd into the Ashram, there is no
room there. But I say that every one of you may enact that Ashram
life individually and collectively. I shall be satisfied with anything that
you may choose from the rules I have ventured to place before you
and act up to it. But if you think that these are the outpourings of a
mad man, you will not hesitate to tell me that it is so, and I shall take
that judgment from you undismayed. (Loud cheers.)1

129. SPEECH AT MADRAS SOCIAL SERVICE LEAGUE2
February 16, 1916
I have been asked to speak to you this evening about social
service. If this evening you find that I am not able to do sufficient
justice to this great audience, you will ascribe it to so many
engagements that I hastily and unthinkingly accepted. It was my
desire that I should have at least a few moments to think out what I
shall have to say to you but it was not to be. However, as our Chair
Lady 3 has said, it is work we want and not speeches. I am aware that
you will have lost very little, if anything at all, if you find at the end of

At its annual meeting held in the Madras Christian College
Mrs. Whitehead, who presided

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

175

this evening’s talk that you have listened to very little.1
For social service, as for any other service on the face of the
earth, there is one condition indispensable, viz., proper qualifications
on the part of those who want to render that service.The question to be
asked is whether those of us who are already engaged in this kind of
service and those who aspire to render that service, possess the
necessary qualifications; because you will agree with me that servants,
if they can mend matters, can also spoil matters, and in trying to do
service, however well-intentioned that service might be, if they are not
qualified for that service, they will be rendering not service but
disservice. What are those qualifications? I imagine I should almost
repeat to you the qualifications that I described this morning to the
students in the Y.M.C.A. Hall,2 because they are of universal
application and are necessary for any class of work, much more in
social service at this time of the day in our national life in our dear
country. It seems to me that we do require truth in one hand and
fearlessness in the other hand. Unless we carry the torch-light of truth,
we shall not see the stall3 in front of us and unless we carry the quality
of fearlessness we shall not be able to give the message that we might
want to give and on proper occasion. When the occasion for testing us
comes—and such occasions do not occur to men so often as they
might imagine, they come but rarely, they are special privileges—
when that supreme final test comes, unless we have this fearlessness in
the other hand, I feel sure we shall be found wanting. But let me
remind you also that these two qualities may be trained in us 4 in a
manner detrimental to ourselves and to those with whom we may
come in contact. This is a dangerous statement almost to make, as if
truth could be ever so handled, and in making that statement I would
like you also to consider that truth comes not as truth but only as truth
so called.5 You will recall the instance of Ravana and Rama and that of
Lakshman and Indrajit in that inimitable book the Ramayana.
Lakshman and Indrajit both possessed the same qualities. Both had
performed austerities, both had attained a certain amount of self
control. It was therefore most difficult to conquer Indrajit. We find

what Indrajit possessed was mere dross and what Lakshman possessed
was of great assistance not only to him, not only to the side on
whose behalf he was fighting, but to us, to whom he has left a treasure
to cherish and to value. What was that additional quality that
Lakshman possessed? Lakshman was divinely guided. He had
religious perception. His life was guided upon1 principle and based
upon religion, and the life of Indrajit upon irreligion. Indrajit knew
not where he was going. Life without religion is life without principle
and life without principle is like a ship without a rudder. Just as a ship
without a rudder and the helmsman will be tossed about from place to
place and will never reach its destination, so will a man without
religious backing, without the hard2 grasp of religion, be tossed about
on this stormy ocean of the world without ever reaching its destined
goal. So I suggest to every social servant not to run away with the idea
that he will be able to serve his fellow-countrymen without these two
qualities duly sanctified by religious perception and divine guidance.
Immediately we have these two qualities, even our mistakes which we
would still commit will not be mistakes that would redound to our
discredit or injure the cause that we may handle or the persons of the
communities we may want to serve.
Our Chair Lady was good enough to take me to the Pariah
Village just behind the compound of the Bishop’s house and
described to me the condition that little village was in before this
League commenced its operations there. After seeing the village, I
make bold to state that it is a model of cleanliness and order and it is
much cleaner than some of the busiest and the most central parts of
Madras. That is undoubtedly a creditable piece of work on the part of
the Social Service League; and if the League can penetrate into the
recesses of Madras and do the same kind of work, certain things which
I have noticed in Madras will be conspicuous by their absence when I
next pay my visit to this great city. (Cheers.) These things stare us in
the face and have got to be remedied. When our Pariah brethren are
amenable to reason and persuasion, shall we say that the so-called
higher classes are not equally amenable to reason and persuasion and
are not amenable to hygienic laws which are indispensable in order to
live the city life? We may do many things with immunity but when we
immediately transfer ourselves to crowded streets where we have

hardly air to breathe, the life becomes changed, and we have to obey
another set of laws which immediately come into being. Do we do
that? 1 It is no use saddling the Municipality with responsibilities for
the condition in which we find not only the central parts of Madras,
but of every city in India without exception. No municipality in the
world will be able to override the habits of a class of people which
have been handed to them from generation to generation. It is a work
that can be done only by patient toil and divine guidance. With these
two immutable weapons in our hands, it can be done only by such
bodies as Social Service Leagues. We are pulsating with a new life and
a new vision which will add dignity to our nationality and will carry
the banner of progress forward. The question of sanitary reform in
big cities is practically a hopeless task if we expect our municipalities
to do this unaided by this voluntary work. Far be it from me to
absolve the municipalities from their own responsibilities. There is a
great deal still left to be done by them. Only the other day I read with
a great degree of pain a report about the proceedings of the Bombay
Municipality, and the deplorable fact in it is that a large part of the
time of the Municipality was devoted to talking over trifles while they
neglected matters of great moment.2 Municipalities will be able to do
very little unless there is a demand for further improvement from the
people themselves. In one of the model principalities in India, officials
and others complained that in spite of their ceaseless vigilance and
efforts, it was not possible for them to turn the people away from the
ways they had adopted and which had become part of their being.
Still the principality showed signs of visible progress. The Dewan of
the place assured him that had it not been for the valuable assistance
rendered by the Social Service League, people would not have done
half of what they had done. Terrorism of officials is of no avail. I
agree with that celebrated saint who said: “It is far better that people
should even remain drunkards rather than that they should become
sober at the point of the sword.” If a man, after an appeal is made to
his heart and after due effort is made to redeem him from bad ways,
continues to believe he must drink himself to death, I am afraid we
must allow him to do so; we cannot help it; we are not going to heap
evil upon evil. It is no use doing physical harm to the man. He may
cease to drink for the time being, but he will return to it again and

again. There is little merit in the physical denial when there is no
mental co-operation. The streets of Kashi, the most sacred place for
the Hindus, are dirty. The same dirt was to be seen even in the
sanctuary where the din and noise was very great. In such a place
there should be perfect orderliness, peace, silence, gentleness and
humility. All these things, I regret to say, were conspicuous by their
absence. The priests do not accept anything less than a rupee from the
devotees. That could not have been the position of Kashi Viswanath in
ages gone by. When people are transported to Kashi in a railway
Express by millions and when the surroundings are altered, one
condition of orderly progress is that people should respond to the new
conditions. What is true of Kashi Viswanath is true in the majority of
cases in our holy temples. Here is a problem for the Social Service
League. It must not be a problem for Government or municipality.
Immediately you begin going to schools, you leave temples alone.
Before we fit ourselves for this work, we should revolutionise the
educational system. We are today in a false position and I promise that
we shall incur the curse of the next generation for this great tragedy
enacted before us. It is a matter for thinking and redressing. The task
may be Herculean, but this reward will be adequate.
I have placed a few thoughts before you at random and I hope
that they will sink deep into you and exercise your hearts. You should
never rest satisfied until you have put your shoulder to the wheel and
assisted to the best of your ability to bring about the necessary
reform.
One other word of advice to the students who travel in third class
compartments. Do not dominate those who wrongly think they are
your inferiors, seeing your costume. If you do so, you will be disqualified for rendering social service.

130. REPLY TO MRS. BESANT
[Before February 17, 1916]
Mr. M. K. Gandhi writes to us:

Mrs. Besant’s reference in New India and certain other
references to the Benares Incident perhaps render it necessary for me
to return to the subject, however disinclined I may be to do so. Mrs.
Besant denies my statement with reference to her whispering to the
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

179

Princes. 1 I can only say that if I can trust my eyes and my ears, I must
adhere to the statement I have made. She occupied a seat on the left of
the semi-circle on the other side of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, who
occupied the chair, and there was at least one Prince, perhaps, there
were two who were sitting on her side. Whilst I was speaking, Mrs.
Besant was almost behind me. When the Maharaja rose, Mrs. Besant
had also risen. I had ceased speaking before the Rajahs actually
left the platform. She was discussing the incident with a group round
her on the platform. I gently suggested to her that she might have
refrained from interrupting, but that if she disapproved of the speech
after it was finished, she could have then dissociated herself from my
sentiments. But she, with some degree of warmth, said, “How could we
sit still when you were compromising everyone of us on the platform?
You ought not to have made the remarks you did.” This answer of
Mrs. Besant’s does not quite tally with her solicitude for me which
alone, according to her version of the incident, prompted her to
interrupt the speech. I suggest that if she merely meant to protect me,
she could have passed a note round or whispered into my ears her
advice. And, again, if it was for my protection, why was it necessary
for her to rise with the Princes and to leave the hall as I hold she did
along with them?
So far as my remarks are concerned, I am yet unable to know
what it was in my speech that seems to her to be open to such
exception as to warrant her interruption. After referring to the
Viceregal visit and the necessary precautions that were taken for the
Viceroy’s safety, I showed that an assassin’s death was anything but an
honourable death, and said that anarchism was opposed to our shastras
and had no room in India. I said then where there was honourable
death, it would go down history as men who died for their conviction.
But when a bomb-thrower died, secretly plotting all sorts of things,
what could he gain? I then went on to state and deal with the fallacy
that had not bomb-throwers thrown bombs, we should never have
gained what we did with reference to the Partition Movement. It was at
about this stage that Mrs. Besant appealed to the chair to stop me.
Personally, I will desire a publication of the whole of my speech2
whose trend was a sufficient warrant for showing that I could not
possibly incite the students to deeds of violence. Indeed it was

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

conceived in order to carry on a rigorous self-examination.
I began by saying that it was a humiliation for the audience
and myself that I should have to speak in English. I said that English
having been the medium of instruction, it had done a tremendous
injury to the country, and as I conceive I showed successfully that had
we received training during the past 50 years in higher thought in our
own vernaculars, we would be today within reach of our goal. I then
referred to the self-government Resolution passed at the Congress
and showed that whilst the All-India Congress Committee and
theAll-India Moslem League would be drawing up their paper about
the future constitution, their duty was to fit themselves by their own
action for self-government. And in order to show how short we fell of
our duty, I drew attention to the dirty condition of the labyrinth of
lanes surrounding the great temple of Kashi Viswanath and the
recently erected palatial buildings without any conception as to the
straightness or the width of the streets. I then took the audience to the
gorgeous scene that was enacted on the day of the foundation and
suggested that if a stranger not knowing anything about Indian life
had visited the scene, he would have gone away under the false
impression that India was one of the richest countries in the world—
such was the display of jewellery worn by our noblemen. And turning
to the Maharajas and the Rajahs, I humorously suggested that it was
necessary for them to hold those treasures in trust for the nation
before we could realise our ideals, and I cited 1 the action of the
Japanese noblemen who considered it a glorious privilege, even
though there was no necessity for them, to dispossess themselves of
treasures and lands which were handed to them from generation to
generation. I then asked the audience to consider the humiliating
spectacle of he Viceroy’s person having to be protected from
ourselves when he was our honoured guest. And I was endeavouring
to show that the blame for these precautions was also on ourselves, in
that they were rendered necessary because of the introduction of
organised assassination in India. Thus I was endeavouring to show, on
the one hand, how the students could usefully occupy themselves in
assisting to rid the society of its proved defects and, on the other, wean
themselves even in thought from methods of violence.
I claim that with twenty years’ experience of public life in the
course of which I had to address on scores of occasions turbulant
1

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

181

audiences, I have some experience of feeling the pulse of my
audience. I was following closely how the speech was being taken and
I certainly did not notice that the student world was being adversely
affected. Indeed some of them came to me the following morning and
told me that they perfectly understood my remarks which had gone
home. One of them, a keen debater, even subjected me to
cross-examination and seemed to feel convinced by a further
development of the argument such as I had advanced in the course of
my speech. Indeed I have spoken now to thousands of students and
others of my countrymen throughout South Africa, England and
India; and by precisely the arguments that I used that evening, I claim
to have weaned many from their approval of anarchical methods.
Finally, I observe that Mr. S. S. Setlur, of Bombay, who has
written on the incident to The Hindu in no friendly mood towards me,
and who I think in some respects totally unfairly has endeavoured to
tear me to pieces, and who was an eye witness to the proceedings, gives
a version different from Mrs. Besant’s. He thinks that the general
impression was not that I was encouraging the anarchists but that I was
playing the role of an apologist for the Civilian bureaucrat The whole
of Mr. Setlur’s attack upon me shows that if he is right I was certainly
not guilty of any incitement to violence and that the offence consisted
in my reference to jewellery, etc.
In order that the fullest justice might be done both to Mrs.
Besant and myself, I would make the following suggestion. She says
that she does not propose to defend herself by quoting the sentence
which drove the Princes away and that that would be playing into the
enemies’ hands; according to her previous statement, my speech is
already in the hands of detectives so that, so far as my safety is
concerned, her forbearance is not going to be of the slightest use.
Would it not therefore be better that she should either publish a
verbatim report if she has it or reproduce such sentiments in my
speech as in her opinion necessitated her interruption and the Princes’
withdrawal?
I will, therefore, conclude this statement by repeating what
I have said before;1 that but for Mrs. Besant’s interruption, I would
have concluded my speech within a few minutes and no possible
misconception about my views on anarchism would have arisen.

132. SPEECH ON VERNACULARS AND EDUCATION,
MADRAS
[February 17, 1916]
Last evening at the Anderson Hall, Madras, under the auspices of the Christian
College Associated Societies, a joint debate was held on the subject, “Shall the
Vernaculars be the Media of Instruction in our Schools and Colleges?” with Mr. M. K.
Gandhi in the chair.
Mr. A. S. Rajam opened the debate on the subject in a short speech. . . .
The Chairman then wound up the debate and said that certainly the question of
racial difference would not occur if vernaculars were to be made the media of
instruction in schools and colleges. In our country, they were one Nation, and even
before the English advent, they did form one Nation and had one common religion.
There were histories to show that our sacred saga had travelled from one part of the
country to another in those days for the purpose of religious gatherings, and thus
brotherly feelings always existed among the people. For the real progress of the
country and for the welfare of the masses, this problem ought to be solved by the
authorities concerned at an early date. These objections against the introduction of
vernaculars were all baseless and the best thing was for the people themselves to
solve this question, and educate the masses of the country through the media of
vernaculars. The rulers themselves would then have to learn the vernaculars of the
country in the interests of proper administration.
A hearty vote of thanks to the Chairman terminated the proceedings.

133. SPEECH AT POONA ON GOKHALE ANNIVERSARY
February 19, 1916
A meeting to celebrate the anniversary of the late Mr. Gokhale’s death was
held in the Kirloskar Theatre, Poona City, on the 19th instant.
There were about 2,000 persons present.
Mr. H. W. Wadia, Bar-at-Law, presided.
Mr. Gandhi, who came down to Poona at the invitation of the Deccan Sabha,
hoped that the anniversary would be celebrated with due regularity and it would take
the form of stock-taking on the part of those who revered the memory of the deceased
and wanted to show their reverence by taking some part of the activity of the
deceased.1 Mr. Gokhale’s work in the Imperial Council and on the Public Service
Commission showed great ability and patriotism. He worked on the South African
question regardless of his health and it had, in Mr. Gandhi’s opinion, cost him ten
years of his life. The speaker suggested that behind all the work of Mr. Gokhale lay
his great spirituality. It was because Mr. Gokhale felt it necessary to spiritualise the
political life of the country that he had brought the Servants of India Society into
being. Mr. Gokhale once said to the speaker that there were moments when he
doubted the efficacy of much of the political work and was distressed by severe
disappointments, but he was saved from such a situation by a consciousness of the
faith that he had deep down in him in the existence of the permanent element and it
was this faith, thought Mr. Gandhi, which made him triumph over all
disappointments and persist in the work.2
The speaker said that he had toured the country during the past year in
accordance with the wishes of Mr. Gokhale, and now without his advice to guide him,
he was at a loss to know whether he was drifting in the right or the wrong direction.
In the course of his travels, he found that the country was vibrating with a passionate
spirit of patriotism, but the bugbear of “fear” loomed large on the horizon. Social
endeavour was impeded by the overawing power of spiritual authority, and in the path
of political activity lay the barrier of political authority. They were the slaves of
circumstances, but they were themselves to blame. It had become impossible for them
to voice in public the opinions uttered in their homes. The spiritual liberty of the
people was usurped by the priests; in politics they were afraid to give expression to
their views. This was a regrettable state of affairs and showed that they were lacking

in backbone. Until they had driven out this craven spirit fromtheir hearts, they were
unworthy of undertaking the great charge bequeathed to them. The heroes of the past
were still with them in spirit. Faith in the lives of the great departed, sincerity,
humanity and patriotism would enable them to weather the storm and establish their
country in its destined place among the nations of the world.
The president in thanking Mr. Gandhi for his address said that he was not
prepared to say anything about the apprehensions and hopes which Mr. Gandhi had
spoken of, but would merely mention that he did not agree with him. He had
considerable experience of politics and entertained the brightest hopes for India....
The Hon’ble Mr. R. P. Paranjpe proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Gandhi and
the Chairman.

135. SPEECH ON INDIAN WOMEN’S UNIVERSITY 1
February 23, 1916
Everyone here knows the gentleman who will soon address us.
Hence I need not speak at length by way of introducing him. He has
taken up the mission of founding a university for Indian women. The
task will entail the revival of different regional languages. He proposes
to start in June an examining and teaching university. It is said that in
our society as it is today men suffer from ardhangavayu2 and this
charge is by and large well founded because we are not able to make
our ‘better halves’ keep pace with us. Circumstances are chiefly
responsible for this state of affairs. Prof. Karve has undertaken this
work in order to improve the condition of women and has set about
it briskly. I must indeed admit that his enthusiasm is matchless. If I
may introduce him in the words of Mr. Gokhale, he is truth incarnate.
We are therefore confident that, even if his work is not crowned with
all the success one may hope for, no harm is likely to result from it
any time. He has devoted twenty years of service to the Fergusson
College and has been managing a widows’ home for as many years.
Now, at the age of 59, he has started on a new venture, a mark of the
highest self-sacrifice and zeal. In Gujarat, we do not have the spirit of
self-sacrifice that we find in Poona. This should make us feel ashamed
of ourselves; Gujarat has, therefore, much to learn from the life of
Prof. Karve.
Concluding the proceedings, Gandhiji said:

Mrs. Vidyagauri[’s3 speech] invites some comments. We shall
accept equality of rights for women, but I think their education should
differ from men’s, as their nature and functions do. In progressive
countries, women receive the very highest education but, after it is
over, they do not have to perform the same duties as men and in our
country women have never to compete with men for a livelihood. The
help this institution receives from us, whatever it be, will not
gounavailing to us. When we start a school or a college here, we shall

I have just returned, having been to Madras, where I saw Chi.
Maganlal and Jamnadas, and to Bombay, where I saw Shri
Khushalbhai and others. Santok and the two girls have come away
with me, for their work there was over and Maganlal had to be all over
Madras. I have advised him to return, after completing his study of
Tamil. He tells me he has done a good job of learning weaving.
Jamnadas and his wife will stay on in Madras. One can’t say that
Jamnadas’s health is normal again. The rest are flourishing.
Khushalbhai and all of us wish that you should now come
away2 . It seems improper for you to engage in business there. Do
what you think best about the house and the small farm. I don’t think
anyone can be sent over from here just now, nor has there been any
such demand. Rather, Mr. Pragji writes to say that, if anyone were to
be sent, Bhaga would have to be relieved.
You need not be much concerned about your coming over here.
It is but natural that I should want you to be with me. If you wish,
however, I shall make other arrangements. Once you are here,
everything will be managed.
I find that Khushalbhai and Devbhabhi3 have taken very well to
Bombay. There is no limit to what I get from them, as though they
owe a debt to me. I am not even allowed to feel that we are only
cousins.

137. INDENTURED LABOUR
The question of indentured labour is a seasonable subject for
more reasons than one. Messrs Andrews and Pearson have just returned from Fiji after finishing their self-imposed labours for the sake
of India which they have learnt to love as they love their mother-land.
Their report is about to be issued. There Mr. Malaviya has given
notice for leave to move a resolution2 in the Imperial Council which
will, if adopted, commit the Government to a repeal of the system of
indentured labour. Mr. Malaviya’s resolution will be, it may be recalled, a continuation of the late Mr. Gokhale’s work in 1912, when in
a speech full of fervour and weighted with facts and figures, he moved
his resolution demanding repeal of this form of labour. The deceased
statesman’s resolution was thrown out only by the force of official
majority. The moral victory lay with Mr. Gokhale. The death-knell of
the system was rung when that resolution was moved. The Government, as it could not then abolish the system, outvoted Mr. Gokhale
but did not fail to note that they must hurry forward to do so at an
early date. Mr. Malaviya’s proposed resolution and the report of
Messrs Andrews and Pearson, which latter, it is known, is to suggest
total abolition of the system, will enable Lord Hardinge fittingly to
close his most eventful viceroyalty removing this long-standing and
acknowledged grievance.
These lines will be merely an attempt to give personal
observations and to indulge in a few reflections upon the question.
For facts and figures, the readers and the public workers must look up
Mr. Gokhale’s speech referred to above and Messrs Andrews and

Pearson’s forthcoming report.
Indentured labour is admittedly a remnant of slavery. The late
Sir William Wilson Hunter, when his attention was drawn to it in 1895,
was the first to call it a state ‘perilously near to slavery’. Most
legislation only partly reflects the public opinion of its time.
Legislation abolishing slavery was really a bit in advance of public
opinion, and that was a big bit. And its effect, like that of all such
legislation, was largely neutralized by the dissatisfied slave-owner
resorting to the dodge of indentured labour. The yoke, if it fell from
the Negro’s black neck, was transferred to the brown neck of the
Indian. In the process of transfer, it had to be somewhat polished, it
had to be lightened in weight and even disguised. Nevertheless, in all
its essentials, it retained its original quality. The hideousness of the
system was forcefully demonstrated when the curse descended upon
South Africa in the shape of indentured labourers from China for
working the gold mines. It was no mere election cry that the l ate Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman1 had taken up when he made the British
Isles from end t o end ring with denunciation of t he system. No cost
was counted as too great for ridding South Africa of the evil. The
great multi-millionaires of Johannesburg spared nothing to be
enabled to hold on to the indentured Chinaman. They asked for
breathing time. The House of Commons remained unmoved.
Mine-owners had to shift for themselves. The interests of humanity
overrode all other considerations. The mines were threatened to be
closed. The House did not care. The millions promised to Mr.
Chamberlain2 would not be forthcoming. The House laughed. Within
six months of the passage of the measure for the abolition of Chinese
indentured labour, every Chinese labourer had been repatriated bag
and baggage. The mines survived the shock. They discovered other
methods of life. And now be it said to the credit of the mine-owners as
well as of the Conservatives who opposed the measure, that both these
classes recognize that the abolition was a great deliverance.
Indian indentured labour is not less demoralising. It has
persisted because its bitterness like that of a sugared pill has been
cleverly though unconsciously concealed. The one great distinction
between the two classes was that the Chinese were brought in without a

single woman with them, whereas every hundred Indian labourers
must include forty women among them. Had the Chinese remained,
they would have sapped the very foundations of society. The Indian
labourers confine the evil to themselves. This may be unimportant to
non-Indians. But for us, the wonder is that we have allowed the sin to
continue so long. This business about the women is the weakest and
the irremediable part of the evil. It therefore needs a somewhat closer
inspection. These women are not necessarily wives. Men and women
are huddled together during the voyage. The marriage is a farce. A
mere declaration by man and woman made upon landing before the
Protector of Immigrants that they are husband and wife constitutes a
valid marriage. Naturally enough, divorce is common. The rest must
be left to the imagination of the reader. This is certain—that the
system does not add to the moral well-being of India. And it is
suggested that no amount of figures adduced to show that the
labourer is far richer at the end of his contract of labour than when he
entered upon it can be allowed to be any set-off against the moral
degradation it involves.
There is another most powerful consideration to be urged
against the continuance of this system. The relations between
Englishmen and Indians in India are not of the happiest. The average
Englishman considers himself to be superior to the average Indian
and the latter is generally content to be so considered. Such a state of
things is demoralizing to both and a menace to the stability of the
British Empire. There is no reason why every Englishman should not
learn to consider every Indian as his brother, and why every Indian
should not cease to think that he is born to fear every Englishman. Be
thatas it may, this unnatural relationship is reflected in an exaggerated
form outside India when the artificial state of indentured service under
the white employer is set up. Unless, therefore, the relation between
the English and ourselves is put on a correct footing in India, any
transference of Indian labourers to far-off lands, whether parts of the
Empire or otherwise, even under a free contract must harm both
employer and employed. I happen to have the privilege of knowing
most humane employers of Indian labourers in Natal. They were their
men. But they do not, they cannot, give them more than the most
favoured treatment that their cattle receive. I use this language in no
uncharitable spirit. The humanest of employers cannot escape the
limitations of his class. He instinctively feels that the Indian labourer is
inferior to him and can never be equal to him. Surely no indentured
Indian, no matter how clever and faithful he may be, has ever
190

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

inherited his master’s state. But I know English servants who have
risen to their master’s state even as Indian servants have risen to their
Indian master’s state. It is not the Englishman’s fault that the
relationship with his Indian employees has not been progressive. It is
beyond the scope of these lines to distribute the blame, if there is any,
on either side, or to examine the causes for the existence of such a
state of things. I have been obliged to advert to it to show that apart
from all other considerations, the system of indentured labour is
demonstrably so degrading to us as a nation that it must be stopped at
any cost and that now.

138. SPEECH AT RECEPTION IN HYDERABAD, SIND
February 26, 1916
About seven thousand people led by the Hon’ble Mr. Bhurgri and the Hon’ble
Mr. Ghulam Hussein, both Mahomedan members of the Bombay Legislative Council,
gave a public reception to Mr. Gandhi at Hyderabad and a procession of fifty carriages
took three hours to pass through the crowded streets owing to numerous stops for Mr.
Gandhi to be garlanded. A eulogistic address in a sandalwood casket was presented to
Mr. Gandhi at a public meeting, where all the speeches were in English except that of
Mr. Gandhi, who preferred to speak in Hindustani.
Mr. Gandhi said that his political guru, the late Mr. Gokhale, had
imposed on him one year’s silence and had bidden him to travel and see things.
The period had passed now and he could speak. Self-government for India was in the
air. A scheme was to be framed by the Congress and the League leaders at Allahabad,
but how many knew what was wanted? It could not be given and taken mechanically.
They could only get as much of swaraj as they fitted themselves for, they had to fulfil
certain conditions and they could fulfil them. One condition was that they should
adopt swadeshi whole heartedly. Swaraj and swadeshi must go together. Then their
motto should be “Fear God rather than man, be the man King or Guru or Moulvi.”
Then they must treat their depressed and poor brethren as human beings. Mr. Gandhi
also reminded his hearers that they could best honour their leaders by copying the
virtues which they ascribed to those leaders. He concluded with an appeal for funds
being raised for the Servants of India Society.
At the conclusion of his speech, he was loudly cheered. At the end “Vande
Mataram” and another national song of the famous Digambar1 were sung, the audience
standing.

139. SPEECH AT HYDERABAD, SIND
February 27, 1916
On 27th February, l916, Gandhiji unveiled before a large gathering the
portrait of the late Mr. G. K. Gokhale in the Holmstead Hall, Hyderabad (Sind). The
Collector was also amongst those present.
Mr. Gandhi, speaking Hindustani, said that character was the cornerstone of
Mr. Gokhale’s work and success. Not only public men, but Government officials,
traders, clerks, coolies and others could elevate and serve the country if duty, and not
authority or self, was the ruling motive. Want of a sense of duty and the spirit of
service caused their miseries. Mr. Gokhale founded the Servants of India Society for
development of character and he wanted to spiritualise political life. The leaders must
not seek praise but serve the country as a duty.

If I did not emulate the virtues of Mr. Gokhale, I would prove
myself unworthy of this unveiling of his portrait. And if you would
not emulate his virtues, you would prove yourself unfit for joining in
this ceremony.1
In conclusion, Mr. Gandhi appealed for aid for the Servants of India Society.

140. SPEECH AT HYDERABAD ON VACCINATION
February 28, 1916
During the course of the day, Mr. Gandhi visited the Narishala, Navalrai
Hiranand Academy, Nava Vidyalaya High School, and Kundanmal Girls’ School. In
the afternoon, Mr. Gandhi was the guest of the Gujarati and Deccani residents of
Hyderabad, who had assembled in the house of Mr. P. G. Mankad in Hirabag. Mr.
Gandhi was given an address and garlanded. After that he drove to the Central Jail
accompanied by Diwan Wadhumal Belaram and his brothers, and strange to say that
the request made to the Superintendent to allow Mr. Gandhi to see the inside of the
Jail was ungraciously refused by him for reasons best known to him. Mr. Gandhi then
went to the Holmstead Hall where he gave a short discourse on vaccination.
He said that he had not given special attention to the subject, but had bestowed
some thought on it. He thought as the vaccine serum was obtained by a process which
spelt torture to the cow, vaccination contravened the fundamental principle of
1

Hinduism which is ahimsa. He said that orthodox Hindus objected to vaccination,
since injection through the arm was tantamount to taking through the mouth. He then
said that vaccination with human lymph was open to objection not only on the same
grounds, but also because it involved the risk of contracting infectious diseases. He
said that it was not a fact that all those who were not vaccinated were attacked with
small-pox, nor that those who were so attacked succumbed to it. He further stated that
it was left to the choice of every individual to go in for vaccination or not. But if the
law of compulsory vaccination was in force in a place and if some person objected to
vaccination on religious grounds, every Indian should stand by him, for compulsion
in one form might lead to compulsion in other directions also.1

141. SPEECH IN REPLY TO ADDRESS, KARACHI
February 29, 1916
In reply to the welcome address presented by the Citizens’ Association,
Karachi, on February 29, 1916, Mr. Gandhi spoke in Hindi to the following effect:

I have been travelling in various parts of India, and in the course
of my travels, I have been struck with the fact that throughout India
the hearts of the people are in a special degree drawn towards me. All
brothers of Hindustan without distinction of creed or caste have been
showing this attachment. But I feel convinced that this remarkable
attachment to me is meant not for me but as a fitting tribute of
admiration to all those noble brothers and sisters of ours in South
Africa, who underwent such immense trouble and sacrifices including
incarceration in jails for the service of the Motherland. It is
undoubtedly this consideration which leads you to be so very kind to
me. It was they who won the struggle and it was by reason of their
unflinching determination to “do or die” that so much was achieved.
Hence I take it that whatever tribute is paid to me, is in reality and in
truth paid to them.
In the course of my tour in India, I have been particularly
struck with one thing and that is the awakening of the Indian people.
A new hope has filled the hearts of the people, hope that something is

recommended passive resistance on the part of those having religious objection and

going to happen which will raise the Motherland to a higher status.
But side by side with this spirit of hope, I also had amongst my
country-men, awe not only of the Government but also of heads of
castes and the priestly class. As a result of this, we are afraid to speak
out what is in us. So long as this spirit remains, there will be, and there
can be, no true progress. You know that at the last session of the
Congress, a re-solution was passed about self-government. For the
attainment of that ideal, you and I, all of us, must work and persevere.
In pursuance of that resolution, the Committees of the Congress and
the Moslem League will soon meet together and they will decide what
they think proper. But the attainment of self-government depends not
on their saying or doing anything but upon what you and I do. Here
in Karachi, commerce is predominant and there are many big
merchants. To them, I wish to address a few words. It is a
misapprehension to think that there is no scope in commerce for
serving the Mother-country. If they are inspired by the spirit of truth,
merchants can be immensely useful tothe country. The salvation of
our country, remember, is not in the hands of others but of ourselves,
and more in the hands of merchants in some respects than the
educated people; for I s trongly feel that so long as there is no
swadeshism, there can be no self-government (“Hear, hear”), and for
the spread of swadeshism Indian merchants are in a position to do a
very great deal. The swadeshi wave passed through the country at one
time. But I understand that the movement had collapsed largely
because Indian merchants had palmed off foreign goods as swadeshi
articles. By Indian merchants being honest and straightforward in
their business, they could achieve a great deal for the regeneration and
uplift of the country. Hence merchants should faithfully observe what
Hindus call dharma and Mohammedans call iman 1 in their business
transactions. Then shall India be uplifted. In South Africa, our
merchants rendered valuable help in the struggle and yet because
some of them weakened, the struggle was prolonged somewhat. It is
the duty of the educated classes to mix freely with Indian merchants
and the poor classes. Then will our journey to the common and
cherished goal be less irksome. (Prolonged applause.)

142. SPEECH AT KARACHI ON GOKHALE
February 29, 1916
Unveiling the portrait of Gokhale at the Khalihdina Hall, Karachi, on Tuesday
the 29th February 1916, Mahatma Gandhi spoke as follows:

In Hyderabad, Sind, also, I was asked to unveil a portrait of Mr.
Gokhale; and there I put to myself and to those present a question
which I put to myself and to you now. That question is: What right
have I to unveil the portrait of Mr. Gokhale and what right have you
to join in the ceremony? Of course, to unveil a portrait or to join in it
is nothing great or important in itself. But the question really involved
in the ceremony is important, viz., are your hearts and is my heart in
reality so much moved as to copy the glorious example of the great
man? The function will have no real significance unless we follow in
his footsteps. And if we do follow him, we shall be able to achieve a
great deal. Of course, it is not possible for all of us to achieve what
Mr. Gokhale did in the Imperial Legislative Council. But the way in
which he served the Motherland, the whole-hearted devotion with
which he did it day and night without ceasing all this it is in our power
to do as the great one did. And I hope that when you leave this hall,
you will bear in mind to follow him and the give expression to your
regard for him. You know that the best achievement of Mr. Gokhale
according to himself was the establishment of the Servants of India
Society. This great institution he has left behind him; and it lies with
us to support it and continue its noble work. It would be best if we
could join the Society. But that will involve the question of our being
fit for it. But if we are not in a position to join the Society, we can all
do the next best thing, viz., render pecuniary aid and swell the funds
of the Society.

143. SPEECH AT KARACHI1
February 29, 1916
I am very grateful to the friends from Gujarat for the honour
they have done me today. Wherever I have gone, Gujaratis have
welcomed me as they have done here. They are more my
neighbours—though all the people in the country are my
neighbours— and I wish therefore to be of special service to them.
However, I must tour the whole of India and it would not be right for
me, therefore, to stay in Gujarat all the time. I have observed that
Gujaratis have spread out as far as Calcutta, to the Madras as well as
the Bengal Presidency for purposes of business. Even in South Africa,
the major part of the business community is from Gujarat. In Karachi,
the Gujarati population is much larger than at any of these places, so
much so that, though the Sindhis are in a majority here, Karachi being
a part of Sind, at first sight it might appear that the Gujarati
population in the city was larger than the Sindhi.
There are three communities in Gujarat—Gujarati Hindus,
Gujarati Parsis and Gujarati Muslims, and all these three have spread
over different parts of the country, most of them for business. It is not
the right way for a business man merely to earn and lay by money
and get rich anyhow by exploiting the poor. In that way, even the
Pindaris used to get wealthy by robbing people. I see no difference
between a man who cheats in business and one who slaps another and
forces him to partwith his money. Business men should follow truth in
their business and not bear hard on people through their operations. I
don’t mean to suggest that this is what you do in your business.
Whenever you may have committed sins, you must have felt the fear
of God as well and you must have done kindness, too, now and then.
It should be the chief aim of a business man to study this virtue of
kindness. Our education is no education if it only makes us physicians
or lawyers. We should try to develop our business. One living example
of this is provided by Sir Dorab2 and Ratan Tata. Sir Dorab does not
educate any of his sons for the profession of a physician or a lawyer.
He will perhaps have quite a number of such physicians in his

employment. You should rather emulate the part he has played in the
development of trade in this country. India has none to equal this
man. Mr. Chamberlain of Birmingham was also a true business man
and, though he is no more, his memory is still cherished in the
business world. Business men may protest and say that they only
know business and do not meddle with other things. They should not,
however, take up any such attitude. They, too, should be in tune with
the atmosphere around them. In fact, the very scriptures of Muslims,
Hindus and Parsis enjoin them to serve the people while they carry on
their business. He is no worthy business man who, in times of famine,
raises the prices so high that the people simply break down. This kind
of thing ruins both the people and the business men. The failure of
the swadeshi movement is also to be attributed to the business men.
Everyone blames it on the Bombay Presidency where the people, keen
only on making money, took no interest in promoting the sale of
swadeshi goods. Just as the Kshatriya’s duty is not killing [but
protecting], so also the business man’s duty is not amassing wealth.

In the course of my tour, I have observed that there is more of
public life in Poona [than anywhere else]. True, public life in Madras
is quite on a large scale but this is due to the much greater student
population there. In Poona, on the other hand, I saw that there were
1

men who could identify themselves with the common people. It does
not seem to be so in Madras. In the whole of India, it is in Poona that
we come across persons from among whom a large number may
emerge one day as leaders of the masses. In Bombay, things are so.
Public life there depends on only one or two gentlemen. It is the
charge of outsiders against Sind that its people are apathetic. I don’t
think so. There is as much public spirit in this province as in any
other. I think the public spirit in Sind will excel that of Bombay.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have just come here to revive my breath and prepare for going
to Hardwar. I shall be travelling yet for a while. I cannot send you the
things you want as both Maganbhai and Manilal are away on business.
There is no one else who knows anything about the things that are put
away.
My life here is curious. I feel like a stranger in the midst of so
many who think they know me. There is kinship only to a certain
extent. Everything I say pleases often, sometimes wounds, rarely
convinces and still more rarely is conviction followed by action. All
this you will see some day when peace takes the place of this seemingnever-to-be-ending war. But I am quite happy in my aloofness. I feel
198

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

that I am right. It is this inner happiness which I would like you to
have. And your present position is just the experience that should give
you the happiness I have described. You have leisure for introspection
and no worry save what you will give yourself. ‘Man does not live by
bread alone.’ Animal enjoyment is the least part of one’s life. But we
have made it the most important of all indeed in some cases it has
become the only important part of life. This ought to be changed.
Each one of us can do it in our own case. Will you not use your
opportunity?
Ramdas is now better. He is not yet sufficiently acclimatized.
That accounts for his indifferent health. He is, however, gaining
ground and is likely to be all right in a short time. Fakiri is still far
from well. He does cause anxiety. He is unable to restrain his palate.
With love,
Yours,

CHI. MAGANLAL,

Herewith a letter 2 received here. Enclosed with it was an
advertisement, which I need not send on. I shall leave on the 15th
instead of on the 14th. I am thinking of taking along both Devdas and
Prabhudas. Ramdas will of course be there.
You must put your heart in Tamil and get through with it.
Shivram has left and there is no one to attend to Tamil now. I think,
therefore, that the thing can be done only when one of us gets trained
up. At present, I can only think of you. I have it in my mind to send
others also to learn Tamil. It seems that Anna will not come at all.
Soyabeans are grown in India. I saw the grain in the farms in
Sind. They sell there whatever seed we want.

Gandhiji was in Sind from February 26, l916 and in Karachi on March 2,
1916. He reached Hardwar on the 14th accompanied by Ramdas, Devdas and
Prabhudas, Chhaganlal Gandhi’s son. The letter seems to have been written a little
before that date.

Untouchables. I believe it so. We shall realize it if someone else gave
us the same disgraceful treatment. No, we have really sinned
grievously. For the sake of our souls, our own good, must we repent
and be restored. We must undergo a prayaschit. And what is the
prayaschit? What is the practical solution? I can tell you that in a
minute. First, we must clearly realize that we have to attain not their
salvation but ours by treating them as equals, by admitting them to
our schools, etc. We only copy the missionaries. To those responsible
for the active working out of the question, I would suggest simply to
think and act more seriously and sincerely and find out what ought to

I have your letter. You are worked up. You have done well in
expressing to me what you feel deeply. We have to act only according
to our capacity. If therefore you cannot follow the pattern of life at
the Ashram, it is only proper that you should leave.
It is futile to think about south Africa. You are physically not fit
for a long journey. Then, Mr. Polak is not certain about himself. He is
in an awkward situation. I am sure you can do nothing there. You
cannot join the Servants of India Society with a view to earning
money. There is only one way of earning money, which everyone else
follows. In your case your health is a hindrance. My opinion is that
unless you had resorted to stealing you could not have earned more
money openly than you have been able to earn through the
Satyagraha Movement. It cannot be said that your economic
condition would have been better if you had not joined the struggle.
Hence, if you cannot continue in the Ashram with a firm mind, you
must explain the situation to your father. You must stay at home and
agree to whatever solution your father suggests. You must follow his
wishes and do as he says, whatever the gain may be. For your trouble,

you should do as he says. In the end even doing this will take you
forward. Even in this kind of self-indulgence there is spiritual
sublimity.
I feel much sympathy for you. It is as difficult for you to leave
the Ashram as it is to continue there. Nobody else is in a situation like
yours. Think maturely. I am abandoning the idea going to the Punjab
and other places. I hope to reach there by Saturday evening or latest
by Sunday.
We shall talk when we meet about what I have been feeling
about Fakiri’s death.
I can understand that your wife cannot work. She has come this
time with an ulterior motive. There really is a snare laid for you. May
God help you.

These village schools have, I find, no common educational
standard. Some are doing as good work as the schools for the rich but
some impart very poor education. To be fair to the Untouchables, one
must send one’s own children to such schools for depressed classes
and make sure that the educational standard is not allowed to fall low.
But one thing more. Let not the education be such as to transform
these village workers into khansamas, dirty hands, petty sub-clerks in
unhealthy towns. Let the education enable them to follow the
occupations of their fathers, to follow them more scientifically, to
follow them with greater skill. Let the schools create an attachment for
village life, for village crafts, for open air independence and for
service among our own.

153. SPEECH AT GURUKUL ANNIVERSARY
March 20, 1916
The following is the text of Mr. Gandhi’s speech at the anniversary of the
Gurukul, as written out by himself:

I propose to reproduce only as much of it as in my opinion is
worth placing on record with additions where they may be found
necessary. The speech, it may be observed, was delivered in Hindi.
After thanking Mahatmaji Munshi Ram for his great kindness to my
boys to whom he gave shelter on two occasions and acted as father to
them and after stating that the time for action had arrived rather than
for speeches, I proceeded:
I owe a debt of gratitude to the Arya Samaj. I have often derived
inspiration from its activity. I have noticed among the members of the
Samaj much self-sacrifice. During my travels in India, I came across
many Arya Samajists who were doing excellent work for the country.
I am therefore grateful to Mahatmaji, that I am enabled to be in your
midst. At the same time, it is but fair to state that I am frankly a
Sanatanist. For me Hinduism is all-sufficing. Every variety of belief
finds protection under its ample fold. And though the Arya Samajists
and the Sikhs and the Brahmo Samajists may choose to be classed
differently from the Hindus, I have no doubt that at no distant future
they will be all merged in Hinduism and find in it their fullness.
Hinduism, like every other human institution, has its drawbacks and its
defects. Here is ample scope for any worker to strive for reform, but
there is little cause for secession.
S PIRIT OF F EARLESSNESS

Throughout my travels, I have been asked about the immediate
need for India. And, perhaps, I would not do better than repeat this
afternoon the answer I have given elsewhere. In general terms, a
proper religious spirit is the greatest and most immediate need. But I
know that this is too general an answer to satisfy anybody. And it is an
answer true for all time. What, therefore, I desire to say is, that owing
to the religious spirit being dormant in us, we are living in a state of
perpetual fear. We fear the temporal as well as the spiritual authority.
We dare not speak out our minds before our priests and our pandits.
We stand in awe of the temporal power. I am sure that in so doing we
do a disservice to them and us. Neither the spiritual teachers nor our
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

political governors could possibly desire that we should hide the truth
from them. Lord Wellington, speaking to a Bombay audience, has
been saying recently that he had observed that we hesitated to say
‘No’ when we really meant it and advised his audience to cultivate a
fearless spirit. Of course, fearlessness should never mean want of due
respect or regard for the feelings of others. In my humble opinion,
fearlessness is the first thing indispensable before we could achieve
anything permanent and real. This quality is unattainable without
religious consciousness. Let us fear God and we shall cease to fear
man. If we grasp the fact that there is a divinity within us which
witnesses everything we think or do and which protects us and guides
us along the true path, it is clear that we shall cease to have any other
fear on the face I if the earth, save the fear of God. Loyalty to the
Governor of governors supersedes all other loyalty and gives an
intelligent basis to the latter.
MEANING OF S WADESHI

And when we have sufficiently cultivated this spirit of
fearlessness, we shall see that there is no salvation for us without true
swadeshi, not the swadeshi which can be conveniently put off.
Swadeshi for me has a deeper meaning. I would like us to apply it in
our religious, political and economic life. It is not, therefore, merely
confined to wearing on occasion swadeshi cloth. That we have to do
for all time, not out of a spirit of jealousy or revenge, but because it is
a duty we owe to our dear country. We commit a breach of the
swadeshi spirit certainly if we wear foreign-made cloth, but we do so
also if we adopt the foreign cut. Surely, the style of our dress has
some correspondence with our environment. In elegance and
tastefulness, it is immeasurably superior to the trousers and the jacket.
An Indian, wearing a shirt flowing over his pyjamas with a waist-coat
on it without a necktie and its flaps hanging loose behind, is not a very
graceful spectacle. Swadeshi in religion teaches one to measure the
glorious past and re-enact it in the present generation. The
pandemonium that is going on in Europe shows that modern
civilization represents forces of evil and darkness, whereas the ancient,
i. e., Indian, civilization represents in its essence the divine force.
Modern civilization is chiefly materialistic, as ours is chiefly spiritual.
Modern civilization occupies self in the investigation of the laws of
matter, and employs human ingenuity in inventing of discovering
means of production and weapons of destruction; ours is chiefly
204

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

occupied in exploring spiritual laws. Our shastras lay down
unequivocally that a proper observance of truth, chastity, scrupulous
regard for all life, abstention from coveting others’ possessions and
refusal to hoard anything but what is necessary for our daily wants is
indispensable for a right life; that without it a knowledge of the divine
element is an impossibility. Our civilization tells us with daring
certainty that a proper and perfect cultivation of the quality of ahimsa
which, in its active form means purest love and pity, brings the whole
world to our feet. The author of this discovery gives a wealth of
illustration which carries conviction with it.
THE DOCTRINE OF AHIMSA

Examine its result in the political life. There is no gift so valued
by our shastras as the gift of life. Consider what our relations would
be with our rulers if we gave absolute security of life to them. If they
could but feel that, no matter what we might feel about their acts, we
would hold their bodies as sacred as our own, there would
immediately spring up an atmosphere of mutual trust, and there would
be such frankness on either side as to pave the way for an honourable
and just solution of many problems that worry us today. It should be
remembered that in practising ahimsa, there need not be any
reciprocation, though, as a matter of fact, in its final stages, it
commands reciprocation. Many of us believe, and I am one of them,
that through our civilization we have a message to deliver to the world.
I render my loyalty to the British Government quite selfishly. I would
like to use the British race for transmitting this mighty message of
ahimsa to the whole world. But that can only be done when we have
conquered our so-called conquerors; and you, my Arya Samaj
friends, are perhaps specially elected for this mission. You claim to
examine our scriptures critically; you take nothing for granted and
you claim not to fear to reduce your belief to practice. I do not think
that there is any room for trifling with or limiting the doctrine of
ahimsa. You dare, then, to reduce it to practice regardless of
immediate consequences which would certainly test the strength of
your convictions. You would not only produce salvation for India, but
you would render the noblest service that a man can render to
humanity—a service moreover, which you would rightly assert the
great Swami 1 was born for. This swadeshi is to be considered as a very
active force to be ceaselessly employed with an ever-increasing

vigilance, searching self-examination. It is not meant for the lazy,
but it is essentially meant for them who would gladly lay down
their lives for the sake of truth. It is possible to dilate upon several
other phases of swadeshi, but I think I have said enough to enable you
to understand what I mean. I only hope that you, who represent a
school of reformers in India, will not reject what 1 have said without
thorough examination. And, if my word has commended itself to you,
your past record entitles me to expect you to enforce in your own
lives the things of eternity about which I have ventured to speak to
you this afternoon, and cover the whole of India with your activity.
WORK OF THE ARYA S AMAJ

In concluding my report of the above speech, I would like to
state what I did not in speaking to that great audience and it is this. I
have now twice visited the Gurukul. In spite of some vital difference
with my brethren of the Arya Samaj, I have a sneaking regard for
them, and it, and perhaps the best result of the activity of the Arya
Samaj is to be seen in the establishment and the conduct of the
Gurukul. Though it depends for its vitality entirely upon the inspiring
presence of Mahatmaji Munshi Ram, it is truly a national and selfgoverning and self-governed institution. It is totally independent of
Government aid or patronage. Its war chest is filled not out of monies
received from the privileged few, but from the poor many who make
it a point of honour from year to year to make a pilgrimage to Kangri
and willingly give their mite for maintaining this National College.
Here at every anniversary a huge crowd gathers and the manner in
which it is handled, housed and fed evinces no mean power of
organisation. But the most wonderful thing about it all is that the
crowd consisting of about the thousand men, women and children is
managed without the assistance of a single policeman and without any
fuss or semblance of force, the only force that subsists between the
crowd and the managers of the institution is that of love and mutual
esteem. Fourteen years are nothing in the life of a big institution like
this. What the collegiates who have been just turned out during the last
two or three years will be able to show, remains to be seen. The public
will not and cannot judge men or institutions except through the
results that they show. It makes no allowance for failures, it is a most
exacting judge. The final appeal of the Gurukul as of all popular
institutions must be to this judge. Great responsibility therefore rests
upon the shoulders of the students who have been discharged from
206

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

the college and who have entered upon the thorny path of life. Let
them beware. Meanwhile hose who are well-wishers of this great
experiment may derive satisfaction from the fact that we have it as an
indisputable rule of life, that as the tree is, so will the fruit be. The tree
looks lovely enough. He who waters it is a noble soul. Why worry
about what the fruit is likely to be?
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING

As a lover of the Gurukul, I may be permitted to offer one or
two suggestions to the Committee and the parents. The Gurukul boys
need a thorough industrial training if they are to become self-reliant
and self-supporting. It seems to me that in our country in which 85
per cent of the population is agricultural and perhaps 10 per cent
occupied in supplying the wants of the peasantry, it must be part of
the training of every youth that he has a fair practical knowledge of
agriculture and hand-weaving. He will lose nothing if he knows a
proper use of tools, can saw a piece of board straight and build a wall
that will not come down through a faulty handling of the plumber’s
line. A boy who is thus equipped will never feel helpless in battling
with the world and never be in want of employment. A knowledge of
the laws of hygiene and sanitation as well as the art of rearing children
should also form a necessary part of [the training of] the Gurukul
lads. The sanitary arrangements at the fair left much to be desired.
The plague of flies told its own tale. These irrepressible sanitary
inspectors incessantly warned us that in point of sanitation all was not
well with us. They plainly suggested that the remains of our food and
excreta needed to be properly buried. It seemed to me to be such a
pity that a golden opportunity was being missed of giving to the
annual visitors practical lessons on sanitation. But the work must begin
with the boys. Then the management would have at the annual
gathering three hundred practical sanitary teachers. Last but not least,
let the parents and the Committee not spoil their lads by making them
ape European dress or modern luxuries. These will hinder them in
their afterlife and are antagonistic to brahmacharya. They have
enough to fight against in the evil inclinations common to us all. Let
us not make their fight more difficult by adding to their temptations.

March 23, 1916
The Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School boys were taken to the Arya Samaj hall in
the evening and Mr. Gandhi addressed them for a short time only as he was feeling
unwell.
He exhorted the audience to have the courage of their convictions, and in
copying or imitating those who directed or ruled, not to be guided by outward show,
such as styles, dress, or by customs, such as meat-eating. He exhorted them to be true
to themselves and then they would be true to India.

155. LETTER TO J. B. PETIT
March 30, 1916
DEAR MR. PETIT,

I have your letter covering check for Rs. 500 on a/c of passive
resistance expenses for which I thank you.
I enclose herewith statement required by you. It is not [the] final
list. For instance, the widows sometimes require travelling expenses.
These are allowed when necessary. Such expenses were incurred only
two months ago.
Imam Saheb has just lost his father and he was paid Rs. 300. He
has not only lost all he had but he has incurred much odium from his
erstwhile friends. The result is that he has lost the trade he used to
carry on. He is now here. Until he is suited it may be necessary to give
him help from time to time.
Maganlal Gandhi and his brothers are my nephews. They are
training under me for national service. One of the brothers 1 who is
free is earning but not enough to bear the whole burden of supporting
the parents.
Maganbhai Patel’s is a similar case. Moreover, he is a chronic
sickbed. Then there is the case of Sorabji Adajania. He holds from a
friend a scholarship. But owing to unforeseen circumstances he may
need additional help up to say [Rs.] 500.

provision may have to be made at this end. What the requirements will
be in South Africa I shall ascertain and let you know as soon as I
receive the estimate.
I need hardly say that the information I am giving you is
confidential. It relates to some public-spirited men who are accepting
support after pressure from me. The rule has been never to disclose
the names of those who have been receiving maintenance money. The
only person apart from the few intimate co-workers in S.A. who knew
anything about the support given was Mr. Gokhale. I have no
objection to the Committee having the information but beyond them
it ought not to march.

F ROM M.K. GANDHI
AHMEDABAD ,

April 1 [1916] 1
MY DEAR FRIEND,

I am at last in Ahmedabad, for some weeks at any rate.Your
things are now being collected. The next mail you should receive
them. I am trying to manufacture biscuits without an oven. You will
like them.
I never previous to the letter under reply received any letter
regarding your things.
I never received the wooden pillow you have referred to in
several letters of yours.
During the week I resolved not to admit to the Ashram for one
year anyone either young or old. Newcomers have taxed me too
much and they have disturbed the ever tenor of the life of the
Ashram. I know you would have, had you been here, long ago pushed
me to this decision. However, I have come to it after bitter experience.
We are now exactly 30, young and old. Of these Maganlal and
Jamnadas are in Madras training in Tamil and hand-weaving.
Jamnadas’s wife is also learning hand-weaving.
The Pariah member’s wife having proved untrustworthy has left
the Ashram.
During the travels just completed, I went to a place called
Dehradun. It is at the base of the Himalayas. You will love the place.
The air is bracing and there are so many walks to the Himalayan hills.
Of course I was there only for a day but was able to know much about
the place. Ramdas, Prabhudas and Devdas were with me.
Have I told you that I have just begun to take cooked food? The
price of fruitarian food is prohibitive here and one cannot get even
dates and monkey-nuts at certain places for love or money. This is a
sad discovery. It tells its own tale. It is there however and one has to
put up with it. This is the 6th day of cooked food. I take rice and
dholl, a vegetable and a lemon. This makes 4 articles. Today I am
1

going to add oil. I have felt extremely weak during the six days and
not half as satisfied as with the fruitarian meal. I shall see what the
addition of oil does for me. Later on I shall take wheat or some other
corn.
Chhaganlal is due here about the middle of the month. West and
Pragji are in charge at Phoenix.
I have written to Polak about you. Every one of our company is
just now involved in his own special troubles. This war has naturally
disturbed individuals in all parts of the world.
Ramdas is getting stronger. Devdas has lost in health. He thinks
too much. He has developed a tremendous sense of responsibility.
And he has become such a fine student. I have been trying to wean
him from his studies. I do not know how far I shall succeed.Budri is
due here today. Sivpujan too has become a regular student but not so
accurate as Devdas.
Fakiri’s death1 was a glorious death. I have seen few dying such
a peaceful death. He was conscious to the last moment. He was
screaming with pain. I said, “Fakiri, take the name of God”. He
began to utter the sacred syllable and went off to sleep from which he
never awoke. The cremation ceremony was the simplest. We gave
information to nobody. We fasted for half the day. We chanted hymns
before the body was taken to the crematorium.
With love to you from us all,
Yours,

I have a reply from the Commissioner saying that under
instructions from the Government of India my application for

159. SPEECH AT CONDOLENCE MEETING, AHMEDABAD2
April 16, 1916
Mr. Patil was one of the ornaments of Ahmedabad. If
Ahmedabad had appreciated this, the people would have filled this
hall to crowding. When I received the invitation to settle in
Ahmedabad, leaving Bombay, one of my friends assured me that, Mr.
Patil being one of the signatories to the invitation, it was safe to accept
it. This showed that Mr. Patil was true to his word and modest as well.
Next, as for the premature death of Mr. Patil, I would suggest that we
should inquire3 why political leaders die at an early age. In my
opinion, such deaths are due to their neglecting their health.

S ATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,
AHMEDABAD ,

Chaitra Vad 2, Thursday, April 20, 1916
THE EDITOR ,
P RAJABANDHU
SIR,

I write this hoping that you will permit me to place before your
readers some of the many reflections which have occurred to me, and
still occur, by reason of Bhai Govindrao Appaji Patil’s death at a
premature age.
I have purposely used the adjective ‘premature’ to denote the
age of the deceased. Any age below 50 should be considered
premature, and Bhai Govindrao died before he was 50. It is a matter
of no small grief that the untimely death of our first leaders deprives
us of the benefit of their ripest years. It seems we suffer from a kindof
vanity. We and our leaders seem to believe that there is some virtue in
remaining more or less ailing and, accordingly, if the leaders leave us
in their premature age, we see an especial virtue in the fact. I think our
leaders, and others too, but particularly our leaders, should consider it
a sin to be taken ill or to remain ill, even if illness should come to
them while serving the public. If we go over all such cases among the
leaders, right from the late Justice Telang2 down to Bhai Govindrao we
shall find that the illness of many of them was such as could have
been prevented. It is the duty of every one of us, especially of our
leaders, to know how to maintain sound health.
I know from experience that we ourselves, in many cases, sow
the seeds of premature death in our very childhood and, in some
measure, our parents do this for us out of their ignorance and
inordinate affection. We generally depart from physical brahmacharya, through marriage, or even otherwise, right in our childhood.
We choose many articles of food merely for their taste or only for the
purpose of putting on fat. The diet of those who have to use mental
1

Congress

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

energy and who lead a sedentary life should differ in its composition
from that of others. As a matter of fact, the diet of such people is
seldom chosen in the light of this consideration. I believe that, in a
climate like that of Ahmedabad, excessive use of ghee is sure to
damage the health of those who work only with the brain. They
should use pulses in very small quantities. Those who have to do
physical labour cannot do without a liberal use of pulses, but to others
who do little physical work, too much of pulses will be like poison.
Almost all students complain of constipation, the reason being that
they have in their diet an excessive quantity of spices, pulses and such
other things, which are bound to lead to constipation. They then
damage their stomach by taking castor oil, Epsom salt or fruit salt, and
ultimately fall a prey to death. Our normal diet does not contain the
vitamins which fresh fruits provide. If we regularly ate fresh fruits in
place of the usual diet, on a particular day of the week, constipation
would disappear and our blood would become pure. I do not suggest
that a major change should be introduced in our diet at once. I realize
that our people would not agree to do so. But they can, in order to
ensure good health, reduce the quantity of spices, make a cautious use
of pulses and begin taking fruits, etc. It cannot be arguedthat this will
require any very strenuous efforts. The habit of taking tea or cocoa is
really very dangerous. I think those who insist on having tea would do
well to study what the people of the tea drinking countries do and how
they prepare tea. But we have made no such study. I do not know if
people elsewhere consume all the tannin in tea, as we do here. The
Chinese do not allow tea leaves to remain in boiling water for more
than half a minute; they strain the tea soon after adding the leaves.
The colour of the mixture would show that very little tannin had been
absorbed in the water. It should not be allowed to become more
yellow than blades of hay, and never reddish in any case. This is the
kind of tea which millions of Chinese drink. They never use milk in
their tea. They do not know what it is to milk cows. They rarely use
sugar in their tea. If at all tea can be prepared so as to cause no harm,
this is the way. Here is what a man, highly experienced and famous,
Doctor Cantlie by name, has to say. He believes that the Chinese take
tea because it is the easiest way of drinking pure water. Below the
boiling point, water cannot absorb the colour of tea, and so they take
tea in place of simple water; that is, they use water which has been
tested [for its temperature].
We are as careless about exercise as about diet. To stroll one or
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

215

two miles at a leisurely pace is no exercise. To hit a billiard ball one or
two hundred times with a cue is also no exercise. When exercise is
taken in this manner in a room with foul-smelling air, the effect is
bound to be harmful. In our predicament, when no other form of
exercise is convenient, walking is the best exercise. But exercise is
worth the name only if one can walk six miles at a stretch in the
morning and again in the evening. The walking should be done
briskly, at a speed of four miles an hour. Thoreau used to walk for
eight hours daily when he wrote his best book. Tolstoy testifies to the
fact that while writing his best books he never used to sit at his desk
before he had had plenty of exercise. He always used to work on a
farm. [Some people say:] ‘We cannot spare a minute from the lients’
work or from public work, and take exercise.” Such talk is s heer
vanity. It would seem to proceed from a belief that but for us public
work would go to the dogs. The Grand Old Man of India, Dadabhai1 ,
has been observing all the general rules of hygiene and has never
departed from his routine of exercise, etc. Hence, we see him alive to
this day, and it would be in no way surprising if this rishi were to live a
hundred years like those of old times. We violate one of the precepts
of the Gita and suffer dire consequences. It says that a person who
eats without performing yajna is a thief;2 the true meaning of yajna
here is physical labour on a farm. If we would make it a rule to work
hard, to work, that is, with a shovel for four hours every day in a field,
for the purpose of digesting our food, and would observe other rules
[of hygiene], premature deaths might be far fewer among us.
When we begin to feel ashamed of falling ill, we shall
undoubtedly acquire good health. In my humble opinion it is the
person, whether man or woman, that has discovered, by experiments,
the rules to be followed in order to preserve his or her health even
while engaged in public work, who can render any great service to the
country.
Yours

MY DEAR FRIEND,

If you were here, you would go out into the jungle and like Job
give way to crying bitterly. Such is the misery we are passing through
just now. Naransamy still obstinately clings to his fever, the after-effect
of smallpox. Chhotam is down with it and so are Bala and
Parthasarathy. Maganlal is sick, Vrajlal (one of the strongest workers)
is sick. Two more are on the sick-bed and I have an attack of pleurisy
which may develop heaven knows to what extent. The only sound
ones are Maganbhai, Manilal, Jamnadas and Mrs. Gandhi. And they
may collapse any day. Our trust is in God. He has a right to try us.
May we have the strength to go through the fire. And let our sorrows
bring you some comfort. Yours are of a different type and avoidable.
Do then rise from them and learn that those who are near and dear to
you are also suffering in their own way. There is no escape from it in
this wide, wide world.
The parcel containing biscuits and sticks is leaving today. I shall
await your criticism.
With love,
Yours ever,

MY DEAR FRIEND,

Sickness is still there. Thambi has written recalling his other
boys. I have told him that if such is his final decision I shall certainly
send them.
Round the dark cloud the silver lining just now is made by Mrs.
Gandhi, Ramdas and Maganlal. Mrs. Gandhi has just now risen to her
fullest height. She keeps well and uses herself for the Ashram.
Maganlal is engaged in developing the weaving industry. Ramdas
makes an excellent uncomplaining nurse. Manilal is, of course, all
right. But I have specially singled out the three as outstanding
personalities just now. At the time of writing my pleurisy is still a
cause of care if not also of anxiety.
You ask why I have taken up [the] 5 articles vow. Well, Hardwar
is a holy place. The Fair I attended occurs only every 13 years. I felt
that I ought to do something. Hence the vow. I have now been on
cooked food for over a fortnight. I do not know that I feel
appreciably the worse for it. Some say in appearance I have improved.
Cooked food had not a fair chance yet. I have taken very little oil. In
fact mostly I avoid oil altogether. The cost is only 1 d. The difference
in cost is tremendous. These are the places I have visited. It is a very
rough map 2 but perhaps you will follow:
I have marked only those I can recall at present.
Surely you had a right to ask for biscuits and they are gone. I
hope you will receive them in good order. With them has been packed
a piece of towel made at the Ashram. A bundle of sticks too has left
and so [has] a box containing your clothes. I have asked Maganbhai

Nothing but death can prevent me from going to Belgaum and

April 30, 1916
A large gathering of people (about 1,000) assembled in Khotibis Wada in
Raviwar Peth, Belgaum, on the night of the 30th of April, to hear Mr. M. K. Gandhi
speak on the subject of “The Depressed Classes”. The audience was mainly composed
of Lingayats and “Untouchables”. R. S. Shivmurti Swami Kanabargi presided. . . .
Mr. Gandhi then rose and said that as he was ill, he would only speak to them
for a minute. He deprecated their opposition to the holding of the Provincial
Conference in Belgaum. The principal object for the holding of the Conference was to
effect a reconciliation between the two political parties.4 Home Rule must be granted
to India and all classes should present a united front in demanding it. If Home Rule
should be granted, no particular class would dominate, otherwise it would not be
Home Rule. He for one would oppose any party or class that wanted to set itself above
the others. He made no distinction between the higher and the lower classes and did
not look with disdain upon a man simply because he was a sweeper or a barber, nor did

165. SPEECH AT BOMBAY PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE
AT BELGAUM1
May 1, 1916
Mr. Gandhi spoke as follows in Hindustani.... He was an outsider in the sense
that he was not a member of the nationalist party or for that matter of any
party. He had no mental desire for listening to the speeches or to his own voice but he
had felt it his duty as an aspirant for national service to study all the institutions he
could and hence it was that he found himself at the Belgaum Conference. He was
desirous of being present there as he was anxious to see the inauguration of an era of
peace between the two great parties which, he was assured, would take place at
Belgaum. It was a matter to him, therefore, of great pleasure that the foundation for
unity was being laid at the Conference. He heartily supported the resolution2 moved
by Mr. Tilak. He was sure he was not expected to endorse every word of the resolution
on the report that was adopted. It should be enough that he found himself in
agreement with the main draft of the resolution. Had the wording of the resolution
been in his own hand, he would probably have omitted some expressions. Mr. Tilak’s
speech left nothing to be desired and he if worked as he was sure he would, and the
nationalist party as a whole also worked truly in the spirit of the resolution and Mr.

Tilak’s resolution, carried unanimously, read as follows:
“That this conference adopts the reports of Messrs Belvi, Baptista and Tilak,
and as in the interest of our Motherland under the present circumstances it is desirable
to unite, resolves to accept, the constitution of the Congress as amended at its last
sessions, though the amendment is highly unsatisfactory, and appoints a Committee
composed of the following gentlemen, to do further work from within:
G. S. Khaparde, J. Baptista, D. V. Belvi, B. G. Tilak and N. C. Kelkar (Secretary).”

Tilak’s remarks, he was sure that the coming union would be a great blessing to the
motherland. It was for that reason that he found himself in disagreement with Mr.
Baptista, who seemed to be so much in tune with the pleaders. If they approached the
question in the pleaders’ spirit they would be constantly picking holes. What was
needed was to approach the national question as common men. They would then
overlook the faults and defects in their erstwhile opponents but would ever seek
points of agreement and contact. Indeed if the party returned to the Congress fold with
an absolutely honest and selfless spirit, ever thinking of the country and its cause and
never thinking of party or personal gain, God would be with them and with God with
them the nation could then [go] forward in the face of the world’s opposition.

There is not a single letter of yours which I have not answered.
It is not a rule with me to write about happenings in the Ashram
myself and so it didn’t occur to me to write about Fakiri. His death
was sublime.
Anna is lost to us for the present. He says that he will not be able
to come over for at least a year and that he doesn’t know what he will
do thereafter. Maganbhai is also leaving, having found it difficult to
follow the Ashram rules. Mama2 continues here.
I am glad you have found a job, and sorry, too, in equal
measure.. You have succumbed to a bad temptation. I wish you could
save yourself from that. There is only one way. While in service, make
the ultimate good your only concern: indulge in no pleasures and, as
much as you can, render disinterested service to others; so, you will
have some inward peace. Reflect Constantly on Bharata’s life.
Rest assured there is not an hour when you are out of our
minds.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have two letters this week from you. You want all the news
from here. I think I have supplied you with it. Today Harilal’s wife,
who has been here for a few days, leaves for Calcutta to join her
husband. Manilal goes as escort. We shall be today 20 in the Ashram
when Chanchi has gone. Maganlal is doing well with his handloom
work. Ramdas and Devdas are going forward with their studies, which
consist of Sanskrit, Gujarati, Tamil and Hindi. I am their sole teacher.
Pra-bhudas is with his father just now. I do not know what Chhaganlal
will do in the end. Maganbhai has left the Ashram for good. He could
not as he said bear the responsibility. He could not comply with all the
rules. So now Maganlal is the only responsible man left with me
barring Manilal. There are other new men. They are good but still
untired. What I have said may yet come true everyone may find it
necessary to leave me. I think I have strength to face that situation.
You say you are morose there. Can you not see much in the above to
give you strength and comfort? To be confined ought not to make the
difference it seems to make in your life. Oh, if you could but see there
are millions much worse off than you are. What of the combatants
themselves? What of the families they leave behind? I wish you could
get out of the Slough of Despond and make the best use of the
situation as it faces you.

170. SPEECH AT CONFERENCE OF COMMUNITIES
AHMEDABAD1
June 4, 1916
I am tired of conferences and speeches and now of hearing my
own voice as well. When Lord Buddha decided to work for the
emancipation of the world, he did not convene a conference and get it
to pass resolutions. Nor did Jesus Christ do anything of the sort. But
not being blessed with such greatness, we convene such conferences
because, I think I am right in this, we lack the requisite strength for
our work. This happens all over the country; and so I don’t say that
yours is the only instance.
There is something novel about the origin of this conference
and its procedure of work. I believe at the same time that it does serve
a useful purpose. The work here is not done through long speeches. I
am glad to see that everyone speaks to the point and keeps himself to
the subject. We must have formed the habit of speaking briefly and to
the point through the business atmosphere of Gujarat. In the changes
taking place today in our communities, we have observed [their] rise
and fall through their own actions and deserts. Champaneri Banias
were once Vaniks2 ; then by vocation they became Ghanchis3 . In the
caste set-up of India, it is in no way impossible that through better
education and economic advance they may again become Vaniks or
attain even a higher status, or that they may be degraded to a level
lower than that of Ghanchi.
Our sin in despising the Antyajas4 degrades the entire Hindu
society. Dhulabhai5 Dhed, who stays with me and who has
accompanied me here, once asked a woman for some water. On the
woman inquiring about his caste, Dhulabhai replied that he wasDhed.
The lady said: “I don’t believe it. You are quite well dressed and
clean; you do not look like a Dhed. Here is water for you.” So saying

she gave him water to drink. But Dhulabhai, after drinking the water,
told her again that he was a Dhed and that he did not wish to deceive
her. In bearing with the abuses she then showered on him, Dhulabhai
showed courage and strength of mind. In just the same way, the entire
Hindu society despises the Dhed people and, as long as this does not
change, we shall not be able to convince the whites of South Africa
and elsewhere of the utter injustice of the aversion they show for us.
Today I take a pledge that, if I am wrong in any belief of mine and if
someone from amongst you proves it, I will accept the correction in
all humility. But, at the same time, I also take another pledge that I will
not rest till I make you change this wrong belief of yours in regard to
the Antyajas.

171. SPEECH ON CASTE SYSTEM, AHMEDABAD1
June 5, 1916
I am in India to learn what I ought to do and I cannot say how
long I shall take to do so. Even in standing now before you to speak,
my aim is to learn something. I have not come prepared to speak on
the subject; I thank you all the same for this opportunity to express
my ideas. Newspapers report my speeches, but sometimes I am not
rightly understood and my meaning is distorted, which is not good for
a satyagrahi which I claim to be. I shall be happy, therefore, if reports
of my speeches are shown to me before they are published: this is
my request. I was quite pleased with the work of the Conference
yesterday, for people spoke briefly and to the point. I for one believe
that the time for conferences is long past and the time has now come
for us to show some results and hold our peace; our words, when they
follow such action, will have an effect all their own. This was the
way of the divinely-inspired Buddha, Jesus, Mahomed and others and
of Martin Luther likewise. I have devoted much thought to the subject
of the caste system2 and come to the conclusion that Hindu society
cannot dispense with it, that it lives on because of the discipline of
caste. Societies all over the world are organized on the principle of

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

caste or varnavyavastha1 . Our society was organized in this manner
for the purpose of self-control, that is, for self-denial. Certainly, there
is a difference between varnavyavastha in the West and among us; but
there is varnavyavastha everywhere, all the same. So long as there are
among human beings impulses which tend to a godly life and those
which tend to a demoniac life, so long will the division of society into
communities remain. It is a vain effort to replace this structure by one
single community. Communities, too, may be born and may die. Mr.
Lyall has affirmed in a book of his not only that among Hindus
communities have made their appearance and died out, but also that,
while outsiders may have joined the Hindu fold, there is no evidence
that the Hindu society converted others to the Hindu faith as
Christians did to theirs. Members of non-Hindu faiths and sects
became Hindus in course of time. the status of a community depends
on its function in society and not on the scriptures. It need not be
imagined that caste rests on the idea that members of a community
may eat together and marry among themselves. If friendly relations
depended on eating together and inter-marriage, the German and the
British would not be fighting against each other. The Rajputs 2 of
Kathiawar do sit together at meals and marry among themselves but
have no end of internecine strife and fighting. Of course, these caste
restrictions have something of value in them. It is but natural that a
father and daughter want to remain in the same social group and
hence communities or groups naturally come to have their distinctive
organizations. But the evils which have found their way into the
various communities must be eradicated without delay. Though it is
important that we apply our minds to the social problems concerning
unmarried girls, widows, widowers, etc.,—and they do require capacity
to think —this has nothing to do with a knowledge of letters. There
are 60 million untouchables in our country. It is necessary to improve
their condition, because this is a blot on Hindu society, one which
India will have to atone for at a heavy price. During my campaigns in
South Africa, the whites used to ask me what right we had to demand
better treatment from them when we were guilty of ill-treating the
untouchables among us. The late Mr. Gokhale and Sir Sankaran Nair3

held the same view about the imperative need for the uplift of this
down-trodden class. In the Punjab, people treat the untouchables
fairly well when they need their services but, when the need is over,
they return to their old ways. Conduct of this kind has nothing
religious in it. We must maintain good relations with these classes all
the time; success will assuredly be ours in anything we do from a
religious motive.

to make your way among the officials by your very bluntness. The
novelty of resistance may shock them at first but pleases them
afterwards. Even they must get tired of ‘nodders’ if one may coin that
noun. And you will have to continue to do that work whether the
people appreciate it or not or rather want it or not. Appreciation need
not be looked for. Do please send me all the correspondence you wish
to. I promise to go through it all. Do not think that South Africa
disappears from my mind. How can it? I owe much to S.A., i.e. to
friendships formed there. In my moments of sadness recollection of
friends working there is no small comfort. Your successes and your
failures are alike matters of deepest interest to me.
Is your little school still going on? How is Granny1 doing? Is she
still as fresh as before? The very thought of her and her working away
is an inspiration. Just now I am reading to the Ashram at prayer time

her to sing to us “When I survey the wondrous cross”! The whole of

Ashram for Madras and has to throw himself on his own resources. If
he makes proper use of this disciplinary period, one may yet make
something of him. He is a very weak boy. I have been fasting during
the week. I fasted 3 days. I broke it yesterday. The last day found me
very weak and suffering much. I am all right now and not much the
worse for the fast. You will please therefore not worry about me or

175. SPEECH AGAINST PRESS ACT1
June 24, 1916
A public meeting of the citizens of Bombay was held in the Empire Theatre on
the evening of Saturday, the 24th June 1916, ‘to uphold the liberty of the Press and
protest against the Press Act of 1910’, under the auspices of the ‘Indian Press
Association’. Mr. B. G. Horniman, Editor of the Bombay Chronicle, presided.
1

230

A brief report of this appeared in The Bombay Chronicle, 26-6-1916.
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

It was a very largely-attended meeting. There were not a few Hindu— Deccani
and Gujarati—ladies among the audience. Principal among them was
the wife of the Honourable Mr. Chimanlal Setalvad with her daughters and daughtersin-law.
Messrs Gandhi, Horniman and Jamnadas D. Dharamsey were received on
arrival with loud cheers. In the case of Mr. Gandhi cheers were called for ‘once more’
by an occupant of one of the upper galleries. Mr. Gandhi delivered his address in
Gujarati, urging that that was the true way of being faithful to his motherland. . . .
Mr. Gandhi said:
MR. PRESIDENT, DEAR SISTERS AND BROTHERS,

I see that in this hall there are several persons laughing, because
I have commenced to speak in Gujarati. (Laughter.) You see we want
to have swaraj; and when we get it, I am sure you will agree with me
that we ought to carry on our business in the Gujarati tongue.
(Laughter.) Crores and crores of our people for whom the swaraj will
have to be carried on, it is impossible to deal with in English, to which
they are quite foreign. It is undoubtedly the fact that in this assembly
we have to speak to a majority of English-speaking people, and to
them I beg to tender an apology for venturing to address the meeting
in my own native tongue. (Laughter.) It may be said that besides those
who know English in this hall, there are not a few who speak Marathi.
I know that there are those who speak that language, but to them I
would respectfully say that hereafter they should learn the Gujarati
language, so that when they have occasion to hear my Gujarati speech,
they will be able to follow me somehow or other. (Laughter.) The
resolution that is placed in my hands runs thus:
That this meeting of loyal and law-abiding Indian subjects of
His Majesty the King-Emperor, believing the existence of a free
public Press to be one of the first essentials of a healthy and
progressive State and necessary to the proper development, political
and moral, of civilized peoples; and further that the extension and
maintenance of freedom in all departments of public life is the surest
guarantee of popular progress and contentment and of mutual trust
between the Government and the people, asks that the Press in this
country should enjoy the utmost liberty of expression, subject to the
legal restraints of the ordinary law and of penalties inflicted only after
proper trial and conviction. (Cheers.)
(Mr. Gandhi explained the resolution in Gujarati.)

Up to now, this Press Act was considered to be innocent and
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

231

innocuous, so far as the high-class journalists were concerned; in fact,
that was the promise given by the Government at the time when this
law was passed to the elected members of the Legislative Council of
His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General. Those members
accepted the enactment under that promise. They were assured thatthe
law would be made operative against only offending journalists. But
from what has now happened in the case of New India, it may be said
that the promise was illusory. We are here disillusioned now as to the
real character of this law on account of the attack made by the
Government against Mrs. Annie Besant. (Cheers.) That circumstance
has awakened us to the true nature of the law. Where is the security
from this law when zulum 1 is practised under it on respectable
journalists? Remember that it is said that at this moment our
Government are in a troublous condition. Remember also that we, the
people of this country, say that what is a troublous condition of the
Government is a troublous condition to us. (“Hear, hear.”) And yet
in the midst of this condition if Government are prepared to drag us
into the clutches of these severe laws, what would be our fate after the
war is over? What will then happen to us is on the knees of the gods.
(Laughter.) What can we do now but to bear our fate with resignation?
That is our only duty. We must take heart that our present fate will
change for the better in the future. It must. I have no faith in these
meetings and in these resolutions. (Laughter.) It is simply a waste of
time to hold these meetings and carry these resolutions. But what else
can we do? There is no alternative for us—the subject people—to do
aught but place on record our view on a given subject. And, therefore,
I have come here in response to an invitation. I feel that something
should be done in this matter—something done so that our complaint
may reach the ears of the Government. (‘‘Hear, hear.”) Whatever we
may say here with a view to expressing our feelings on the subject, it is
an undoubted fact that we cannot express a hundredth part of what we
actually feel in our minds on account of this outrageous enactment.
We read newspapers. Yes, we do. But are you sure that you read the
real thoughts of the editor. I think not. Independent views of writers
are not published. What is published is otherwise and, therefore, one
can say that it is advisable to read the opposite into the words that
appear in the newspapers. (Laughter.) I am not at all exaggerating. I
have myself been editor of a newspaper for several years and can
1

232

Repression
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

explain from personal experience the difficulties which the editor has
to undergo in the true discharge of his duties I am not disputing the
fact that some restraint is necessarily to be exercised on newspapers,
but there is this to be remembered that in the exercise of such a
restraint, discretion and limit should not be lost sight of. It is only with
unwarranted restraint that I quarrel. For flimsy reasons, Government
officials ought not to exercise restraint on the people’s right to
express their views. (Cheers.) Restraint means inducement to indulge
in fallacious or misleading thoughts. That leads one to become the
enemy of my Government. (Laughter.) My genuine feelings are
suppressed; I cannot give free vent to them; I write the reverse of what
I feel. By reason of such enactments, there cannot be an unalloyed
affection for our rulers among the 30 crores of our countrymen.
There should be pure justice administered in India. (Cheers.) The
Government are like- our trustees or protectors. To speak the truth I
do not like the word ‘trustee’. India is no longer in a state of
childhood, and, therefore, she does not require a trustee or a protector.
India is one of the most ancient countries; she is one of the most
experienced countries; can her subjects be said with propriety to be
inexperienced or in a state of childhood? No; we Indians stand in no
need of a protector. All that he need do for us is to dispense pure
justice. We, the people of India, are as liberal in our views as we are
innocent of any mischievous tendencies; all that we are is that we are
despondent. But we will never be guilty of anything disloyal. Under
these circumstances, I beg to appeal to the Government to do
everything that is just and righteous; if that is done, there would be no
necessity for these meetings. (‘‘Hear, hear” and laughter.) That is a
general request. My special request to them is on behalf of the
newspaper writers. I say, ‘Do not harass the respectable editors and
proprietors.’ I further say, ‘Treat us as generously as you would the
English people. We the people of India are not a race of hypocrites.
(Laughter.) We are enlightened, good and civilized people.’ (‘‘Hear,
hear.”) To my newspaper-writer brethren I say, ‘Say openly whatever
you have to say.’ (“Hear, hear.”) That is our duty. We should rely on
ourselves to expatiate on our grievances, but we must not forget that
we have to do that under certain restrictions born of politeness and
sobriety. Whenever we are face to face with a political catastrophe, we
should never hesitate to say in as clear terms as possible what we feel
and desire to say. (“Hear, hear.”) For such plain-speaking and honest
pleading of our cause if we are punished by the Government, well, let
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

233

them do so. (“Hear, hear” and laughter.) What can they do if the
worst comes to the worst? They will take our bodies at best.
(Laughter.) Very well, if our bodies are taken away, our souls will
become free. (“Hear, hear” and roars of laughter.)

I know that you are not mentally as happy as you ought to be. I have

Christian half succumbs to the suggestion. Hopeful strenuously fights
against it and argues that when we find ourselves in a tight corner, we
should think of those who might be in a still tighter [one]. The
argument is good. There are millions in a much worse condition than

178. RAILWAY PASSENGERS1
[Before July 26, 1916] 2
No one doubts that railway passengers are put to many
hardships. Against many of these, we have the remedy in our own
hands. Unity is in the air all over India. If we did no more than resort
to this, quite a few of the hardships could be overcome. This article
makes some suggestions on how they could be. Those into whose
hands this may fall are requested to read it carefully and afterwards to
read it out to others who cannot read. The reader will easily guess that
the cost of paper and printing must have been met by someone with a
public spirit and, in view of that at any rate, he will realize that the
article should not be treated lightly merely because he has got it free.
To the authorities, I shall say:
If you are a station master, you can remove many of the
hardships of passengers.
Using courtesy in your dealings with poor passengers, you set
an example to your subordinates.
If you are a ticket collector, with a little reflection you will
realize that the poor should receive the same time and attention that

you give to first and second-class passengers.
The railways depend on the poor for their existence and you
owe your salaries largely to the money received from them.
Some booking clerks abuse the poor, address them slightingly,
and on top of that delay issuing tickets to them as long as they can.
This is no way of showing one’s importance. Issuing a ticket without
delay to anyone asking for it saves the latter’s time and you lose
nothing by doing so.
If you are a policeman, you should refrain from accepting
bribes, resolve not to shove the poor people about but behave towards
them with kindness. You should understand that you are servants of
the people and not their masters. It is your duty to help them out of
their difficulties. That you should yourself become the cause of
difficulties is sheer injustice.
To educated passengers, I shall say:
Most of you like showing that you are educated and that you
have some patriotism in you. If you use your patriotism in doing
good to the illiterate and poor passengers with whom you come into
contact, you will be doing national service without having to search
for an occasion.
For instance, if a passenger is being ill-treated, you can help him
in a number of ways, Even if you do not generally travel third-class,
your doing so occasionally just to get experience is likely to benefit
the third-class passengers very much.
If you go in their midst, without disclosing your status, for
purchasing tickets, etc., it will be easy for you to find a remedy for the
difficulties you will experience in the process and the facilities offered
to you will be available before long to the people at large.
Sometimes educated people themselves become the cause of
injustice to third-class passengers. They are impatient to get their
tickets first, may enjoy special facilities in trains and occupy more
space than they need; the poor are put to difficulties in consequence.
The educated class must certainly refrain from making itself a cause
of injustice in this manner, if it can do nothing else.
It is your duty to write to the authorities about any deficiencies
that you may observe on stations or trains.
To passengers in general, I shall say:
No matter what category of passengers you belong to, educated
236

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

or uneducated, rich or poor, if you bear in mind the following
suggestions, 75 per cent of the hardships of passengers will disappear
in a moment:
1. You will lose nothing, and others will gain through your
restraint, if, instead of pushing yourself forward when getting to the
platform or boarding the train, you don’t mind being the last and act
accordingly.
2. Having taken your seat in the train, you should know that, up
to the number indicated, others have as much right to a seat [in the
compartment] as you. Hence, if you stop others from entering, you
will violate the moral law through falsehood and will also break a
Railway regulation.
3. If you have with you only as much luggage as third-class
passengers are entitled to carry, others will be able to sit in comfort. If
you can afford to carry more luggage, you had better put the excess
in the luggage van and pay the additional charge.
4. Your luggage should be of a kind that can be easily stowed
away under a bench or placed on the shelf.
5. If you are well-to-do and have no philanthropic intentions,
you should seek your comfort by purchasing an upper-class ticket.
By purchasing a third class ticket out of sheer miserliness, you will
make yourself a burden on the poor. But even if you do not want to
travel upper-class, you should certainly not use your funds so as to
make your luggage and yourself a nuisance to your fellowpassengers.
6. You should bear in mind that all long-distance passengers are
entitled to some facility for sleeping; you can have, therefore, no more
than your share of sleep.
7. If you are a smoker, you should consider that, being in a
train, you can smoke only with others’ permission and so as not to
inconvenience them.
8. If, when you want to spit, you do so where the passengers rest
their feet, the place will become extremely dirty and there is a risk of
one contracting some disease; those other passengers, moreover, who
are particular about rules of cleanliness will find your dirty habit
intolerably painful.
9. If you use the railway lavatories with due care, everyone will
be the happier for that. In using them carelessly, you take no thought
of the passengers who may follow you.

10. Instead of making distinctions when you travel, such as
that you are a brahmin or a Vaisya or a Sudra and someone else
belongs to another class or that you are a Hindu and another a
Muslim, or that you are from Bombay Presidency and another from
Madras Presidency, and creating ill-will in consequence, if you think
of all as children of India who have for the once assembled under one
roof, and cherish a brotherly feeling for all, you will be happy this
very moment and bring glory to India.

179. SPEECH ON ‘THE SECRET OF SATYAGRAHA
IN SOUTH AFRICA’1
July 27, 1916
In brief, the significance of satyagraha consists in the quest for a
principle of life. We did not say to anyone in so many words that our
fight was in pursuance of this quest. If we had said so, the people there
would only have laughed at us. We only made known the secondary
aim of our movement, which was that the Government there, thinking
us lowly and mean, was making laws to oust us from the country, and
that it was right for us to defy these laws and show that we were brave.
Suppose the Government passes a law saying that Coloured persons
shall wear yellow caps; in fact, a law of this kind was made in Rome
for the Jews. If the Government intended to treat us in a similar
fashion and made a Law that appeared to humiliate us, it was for us to
make it clear to the Government that we would not obey such a law. If
a child says to his father: ‘Please put on your turban the wrong side
up for me’, the father understands that the child wants to have a laugh
at his expense and at once obeys the command. But when someone
else, with uncharitable motives, says the same thing, he clearly answers,
‘Look, brother, so long as my head is on my shoulders, you cannot
humiliate me in this manner. You conquer my head first and then
make me wear my turban in any fashion you please.’ The
Government there in a similar way, thinking the Indians lowly, wanted
to treat them as slaves and as far as possible to prevent their coming
1

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

into the country. And with this end in view, it began inventing ever
new laws such as putting names of Indians in a separate register,
making them give finger-prints in the manner of thieves and bandits,
forcing them to live in particular areas, forbidding their movement
beyond a specified boundary, making rules for them to walk on
particular foot-paths and board specified carriages in trains, treating
their wives as concubines if they could not produce marriage
certificates, levying from them an annual tax of forty-five rupees per
capita, etc., etc. Often a disease manifests itself in the body in various
forms. The disease in this case, as has been explained, was the evil
purpose of the Government of South Africa, and all the rules and
regulations mentioned above were the various forms that it took. We,
therefore, had to prepare ourselves to fight against these.
There are two ways of countering injustice. One way is to smash
the head of the man who perpetrates injustice and to get your own
head smashed in the process. All strong people in the world adopt this
course. Everywhere wars are fought and millions of people are killed.
The consequence is not the progress of a nation but its decline.
Soldiers returning from the front have become so bereft of reason that
they indulge in various anti-social activities. One does not have to go
far for examples. In the Boer War, when the British won a victory at
Mafeking, the whole of England, and London in particular, went so
mad with joy that for days on end everyone did nothing but dance
night and day! They freely indulged in wickednesses and rowdyism
and did not leave a single bar with a drop of liquor in it. The Times,
commenting, said that no words could describe the way those few days
were spent, that all that could be said was that “the English nation
went amafficking [a-Mafeking]”. 1 Pride makes a victorious nation
bad-tempered. It falls into luxurious ways of living. Then for a time, it
may be conceded, peace prevails. But after a short while, it comes
more and more to be realized that the seeds of war have not been
destroyed but have become a thousand times more nourished and
mighty. No country has ever become, or will ever become, happy
through victory in war. A nation does not rise that way, it only falls
further. In fact, what comes to it is defeat, not victory. And if,
perchance, either our act or our purpose was ill-conceived, it brings
disaster to both belligerents.

(May 17, 1900).

239

But through the other method of combating injustice, we
alone suffer the consequences of our mistakes, and the other side is
wholly spared. This other method is satyagraha. One who resorts to it
does not have to break another’s head; he may merely have his own
head broken. He has to be prepared to die himself suffering all the
pain. In opposing the atrocious laws of the Government of South
Africa, it was this method that we adopted. We made it clear to the said
Government that we would never bow to its outrageous laws. No
clapping is possible without two hands to do it, and no quarrel without
two persons to make it. Similarly, no State is possible without two
entities [the rulers and the ruled]. You are our sovereign, our
Government, only so long as we consider ourselves your subjects.
When we are not subjects, you are not the sovereign either. So long as
it is your endeavour to control us with justice and love, we will let you
to do so. But if you wish to strike at us from behind, we cannot permit
it. Whatever you do in other matters, you will have to ask our opinion
about the laws that concern us. If you make laws to keep us
suppressed in a wrongful manner and without taking us into
confidence, these laws will merely adorn the statute-books. We will
never obey them. Award us for it what punishment you like, we will
put up with it. Send us to prison and we will live there as in a paradise.
Ask us to mount the scaffold and we will do so laughing. Shower what
sufferings you like upon us, we will calmly endure all and not hurt a
hair of your body. We will gladly die and will not so much as touch
you. But so long as there is yet life in these our bones, we will never
comply with your arbitrary laws.
It all began on a Sunday evening in Johannesburg when I sat on
a hillock with another gentleman called Hemchandra. The memory of
that day is so vivid that it might have been yesterday. At my side lay a
Government Gazette. It contained the several clauses of the law
concerning Indians. As I read it, I shook with rage. What did the
Government take us for? Then and there I produced a translation of
that portion of the Gazette which contained the said laws and wrote
under it: “I will never let these laws govern me.” This was at once
sent for publication to Indian Opinion at Phoenix. I did not dream at
the time that even a single Indian would be capable of the
unprecedented heroism the Indians revealed or that the satyagraha
movement would gain the momentum it did.
Immediately, I made my view known to fellow-Indians and
240

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

many of them declared their readiness for satyagraha. In the first
conflict, people took part under the impression that our aim would be
gained after only a few days of suffering. In the second conflict, there
were only a very few people to begin with but later many more came
along. Afterwards when, on the visit of Mr. Gokhale, the Government
of South Africa pledged itself to a settlement, the fight ceased. Later,
the Government treacherously refused to honour its pledge; on which
a third satyagraha battle became necessary. Gokhale at that time asked
me how many people I thought would take part in the satyagraha. I
wrote saying they would be between 30 and 60. But I could not find
even that number. Only 16 of us took up the challenge. We were
firmly decided that so long as the Government did not repeal its
atrocious laws or make some settlement, we would accept every
penalty but would not submit. We had never hoped that we should
find many fellow-fighters. But the readiness of one person without
self-interest to offer himself for the cause of truth and country always
has its effect. Soon there were twenty thousand people in the
movement. There was no room for them in the prisons, and the blood
of India boiled. Many people say that if Lord Hardinge had not
intervened, a compromise would have been impossible. But these
people forget to ask themselves why it was that Lord Hardinge
intervened. The sufferings of the Canadian Indians were far greater
than those of the South African Indians. Why did he not use his good
offices there? Where the spiritual might of thousands of men and
women has been mustered, where innumerable men and women are
eager to lay down their lives, what indeed is impossible? There was no
other course open for Lord Hardinge than to offer mediation and he
only showed his wisdom in adopting it. What transpired later is well
known to you: the Government of South Africa was compelled to
come to terms with us. All of which goes to show that we can gain
everything without hurting anybody and through soul-force or
satyagraha alone. He who fights with arms has to depend on arms and
on support from others. He has to turn from the straight path and seek
tortuous tracks. The course that a satyagrahi adopts in his fight is
straight and he need look to no one for help. He can, if necessary,
fight by himself alone. In that case, it is true, the outcome will be
somewhat delayed. If I had not found as many comrades in the South
African fight as I did, all that would have happened is that you would
not have seen me here in your midst today. Perhaps all my life would
have had to be spent in the struggle there. But what of that? The gain
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

241

that has been secured would only have been a little late in coming. For
the battle of satyagraha one only needs to prepare oneself. We have to
have strict self-control. If it is necessary for this preparation to live in
forests and caves, we should do so.
The time that may be taken up in this preparation should not be
considered wasted. Christ, before he went out to serve the world, spent
forty days in the wilderness, preparing himself for his mission.
Buddha too spent many years in such preparation. Had Christ and
Buddha not undergone this preparation, they would not have been
what they were. Similarly, if we want to put this body in the service of
truth and humanity, we must first raise our soul by developing virtues
like celibacy, non-violence and truth. Then alone may we say that we
are fit to render real service to the country.
In brief, the aim of the satyagraha struggle was to infuse
manliness in cowards and to develop the really human virtues, and its
field was the passive resistance against the Government of South
Africa.

AHMEDABAD ,

September 5 [1916] 1
MY DEAR MILLIE,

I have your letter today. Even if Henry comes, you will be there
to receive this letter. I had Henry’s long letter but I did not wish to
interfere with his plans, so I said nothing. I quite share your feeling
that if his stay there can only increase the bitterness of his soul, it is
better that he should not be so near the fire. All the same it will be a
calamity for South Africa, his permanent withdrawal. Both the races
will lose a common friend. But at times, it is better to lose one’s
friends. We sometimes know them only after the are gone.
Yes, you will feel very lonely. I fear very much that you will
never have a really settled life. You will, therefore, have to find peace
in preparedness to move on when required. I do not share Henry’s
optimism about the London practice. Anyway I shall be perfectly
useless in helping him in that direction. I know not a soul to whom I
could appeal for such help. If however, he cannot find his way to
settle in London, he will find little difficulty in doing so here. There is
ample scope for his energy in India. But I will not anticipate the
future. I do not fear the intimate issue. We have a common belief in
the goodness of God. Though the path immediately in front of us
may be full of darkness, as to the destination to be reached, there
never would be any doubt.
Of course, I shall go to Bombay to meet Henry unless his
coming synchronizes with the Provincial Conference meeting here.
Morgan-Bush affair is a sad thing. Thambi never wrote again to
me. I am ready to send the boys if he wants them.
We are here a busy nine all engaged in hand-weaving. To me it
appears as a great thing. But we shall see. Just now we expect that we
shall be self-supporting in a year’s time through this work.
With love to you all,
Yours,

F ROM M.K. GANDHI
AHMEDABAD ,

September 10, 1916
MY DEAR FRIEND,

I was examining yesterday one of your boxes to see if time had
done any damage. I did not see much damage done but it brought to
mind the old days when we cooked our own meals. I compared those
times to the present ones. It saddened me to think that you were not
here to share the greater simplicity. Everything in the box that I
examined betrayed greater luxury than is allowed at present. I cannot
give you an adequate picture of it. The life has to be seen. There is
much left undone before the life can become grandly simple. There is
a shoddiness about it which I would like to get rid of. But that cannot
be until we have built our own cottages.
News from South Africa show that Polak may leave South
Africa in October for India. He does not want to settle here. He wants
to see if he can get Indian connections for practice in London. There
is not much hope of it.
I know you write regularly but the delivery has become
irregular. There is again nothing from you this week. I hope mine
you receive regularly.
There is again a storm in the Ashram. The Pariah family had
temporarily gone. They returned yesterday. Mrs. Maganlal therefore
suddenly decided to leave. I offered no opposition and she with her
children has gone to Rajkot. Poor Maganlal! He is going through the
most terrible times of his life. He feels most keenly this separation
from those that [are] nearest him. He does not know what his duty is.
He does not want to leave me and he can hardly bear the present blow.
The Maganlal of olden days ≈ robust, jovial, quickhanded and quickwitted is no more to be seen. He has aged. He is careworn. He is rarely
healthy. He is absent-minded, without hope, without peace. I do not
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

245

know what to do for him and how to help him. One can only trust that
time will heal all the wounds and that he will yet be his old self again.
Manilal is at Madras ever finding out ways of ease and luxury.
The life of discipline is gone for him. That of indulgence has begun.
He has seen friends. They have begun to fondle him. He has not been
able to resist them. Heaven knows what he will now be when he returns
from Madras.
Most of the inmates of the Ashram have gone out for a picnic.
They have taken roasted wheat and gram flour with them for food
with radishes as a salad. The distance is only five miles. They return in
the evening.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I was assisting the carpenter yesterday. Here carpenters have to
practically make their own tools. They make their own handles. They
turn one tool into some other. The carpenter here wanted a handle to
his screwdriver. I had to assist him at that. He made it out of a piece of
ebony. I thought he had turned out a piece of art in about two hours.
You will probably laugh at it. As I was sitting opposite the carpenter, I
thought of you and asked myself what you would say to it all ≈ the
manner of working it, pressing two hours in the middle of his work,
giving so much time to a mere handle! Such is life here. For me there
is poetry in it. There is no mad rush in this sort of life.
Polak is expected here in a month’s time. There is no cable yet.
I may receive one any day.
Naransamy, Parthasarathy and Bala are all down. The first two
have a violent attack of indigestion. Naransamy is out of danger now.
The other two have been very severely ill but they were never in the
danger zone. All have yielded to home treatment.

except to say that it hurts me to think that you felt so hurt. For once
you have taken Mr. Rustomjee seriously. I know that you must soon
after writing that letter have regained your usual gaiety and
philosophic calm. In any event this is merely to say that you have the
power to vote to yourself as much as you need per month. Please use
it without hesitation. Funds you have there. I shall answer for you and
your use of them. I see nothing wrong in your using the funds. They
were sent for the struggle. You and a few others now are in the
struggle which must be maintained. I hope therefore that you will not
argue with me again about the rightness of the act. Imam Saheb now
sees the thing properly.
Mr. Petit has asked me more than once for the balance of the
fund. What is the balance there now. Do please also send me the items
of expenditure after the date up to which the accounts were rendered.
We return only the balance which is left after providing for your
losses there.

VAIDYA KAVISHRI,

I do not believe that there is need for girls to be taught English.
In my view, for women as well as men, Tulsi’s Ramayana seems the
best. All Hindus must be conversant with the Gita. Complete
education here must include elementary arithmetic and geography.
Moral education too is to be included and that would cover the duties
of a housewife. I have not found it necessary to give any special
importance to music, drawing, etc. Keeping in view the conditions in
the country I feel a general knowledge of agriculture, and weaving,
and health education should be included in the education for every

we cannot create schools giving such education, all parents should
themselves educate their children or engage private tutors. Married
women should be educated by their husbands who should find time
for it.

190. LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH
F ROM M. K. GANDHI
AHMEDABAD ,

October 8, 1916
MY DEAR FRIEND,

My Yours, sorrows are coming thick on me. Sickness I cannot
get rid of in spite of the greatest care and precaution. Ramdas is down
again. So is Maganlal and two others. Prabhudas is more or less an
invalid. Fatima and Amina are rotting with boils. Imam Saheb is just
recovering. The three Naidoo boys only just recovered. This means
nearly half the company needing attention. If I had only doctoring
and nursing to attend to I should not mind but the kitchen and the
looms and some public work ≈ this fills the cup. And yet I know I
should not mind. I need Job’s patience. All this news should make
you see that yours is by no means the worst state and yet if you feel
miserable it is clearly a case of “mind is its own place, it can make
heaven of hell and hell of heaven”.1
Andrews has returned from Japan and may be coming to
Ahmedabad shortly.
With love,

191. ON AHIMSA: REPLY TO LALA LAJPAT RAI
October, 1916
Had Lala Lajpat Rai1 first ascertained what I had actually said on
ahimsa, his remarks2 in The Modern Review for last July would not
have seen the light of day. Lalaji rightly questioned whether I actually
made the statements imputed to me. He says, that if I did not, I should
have contradicted them. In the first place, I have not yet seen the
papers which have reported the remarks in question or those wherein
my remarks were criticised. Secondly, I must confess that I would not
undertake to correct all the errors that creep into reports that appear in
the public press about my speeches. Lalaji’s article has been much
quoted in the Gujarati newspapers and magazines; and it is perhaps as
well for me to explain my position. With due deference to Lalaji, I
must join issue with him when he says that the elevation of the
doctrine of ahimsa to the highest position contributed to the downfall
of India. There seems to be no historical warrant for the belief that an
exaggerated practice of ahimsa synchronised with our becoming
bereft of many virtues. During the past fifteen hundred years, we have
as a nation given ample proof of physical courage, but we have been
torn by internal dissensions and have been dominated by love of self
instead of love of country. We have, that is to say, been swayed by the
spirit of irreligion rather than of religion.
I do not know how far the charge of unmanliness can be made
good against the Jains. I hold no brief for them. By birth I am a
Vaishnavite3 , and was taught ahimsa in my childhood. I have derived
much religious benefit from Jain religious works, as I have from
scriptures of the other great faiths of the world. I owe much to the
living company of the deceased philosopher Raja Chand Kavi 4 who
was a Jain by birth. Thus though my views on ahimsa are a result of
my study of most of the faiths of the world, they are now no longer

dependent upon the authority of these works. They are a partof my
life and if I suddenly discovered that the religious books read by me
bore a different interpretation from the one I had learnt to give them,
I should still hold to the new of ahimsa as I am about to set forth here.
Our shastras seem to teach that a man who really practises
ahimsa in its fullness has the world at his feet, he so affects his
surroundings that even the snakes and other venomous reptiles do him
no harm. This is said to have been the experience of St. Francis of
Assisi.
In its negative form, it means not injuring any living being,
whether by body or mind. I may not therefore hurt the person of any
wrong-doer, or bear any ill will to him and so cause him mental
suffering. This statement does not cover suffering caused to the
wrong-doer by natural acts of mine which do not proceed from ill
will. It, therefore, does not prevent me from withdrawing from his
presence a child whom he, we shall imagine, is about to strike. Indeed
the proper practice of ahimsa required me to withdraw the intended
victim from the wrong-doer, if I am in any way whatsoever the
guardian of such a child. It was therefore most proper for the passive
resisters of South Africa to have resisted the evil that the Union
Government sought to do to them. They bore no ill will to it. They
showed this by helping the Government whenever it needed their help.
Their resistance consisted of disobedience of the orders of the
Government, even to the extent of suffering death at their hands.
Ahimsa requires deliberate self-suffering, not a deliberate injuring of
the supposed wrong-doer.
In its positive form, ahimsa means the largest love, the greatest
charity. If I am a follower of ahimsa, I must love my enemy. I must
apply the same rule to the wrong-doer who is my enemy or a stranger
to me, as I would to my wrong-doing father or son. This active
Ahimsa necessarily includes truth and fearlessness. A man cannot
deceive the loved ones; he does not fear or frighten him or her.
vHk;nku (Gift of life) is the greatest of all gifts. A man who gives it in
reality disarms all hostility. He has paved the way for an honourable
understanding. And none who is himself subject to fear can bestow
that gift. He must therefore be himself fearless. A man cannot then
practise ahimsa and be a coward at the same time. The practice of
ahimsa calls forth the greatest courage. It is the most soldierly of a
252

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

soldier’s virtues. General Gordon1 has been represented in a famous
statue as bearing only a stick. This takes us far on the road to ahimsa.
But a soldier, who needs the protection of even a stick, is to that extent
so much the less a soldier. He is the true soldier who knows how to die
and stand his ground in the midst of a hail of bullets. Such a one was
Ambarish who stood his ground without lifting a finger, though
Durvasa did his worst? The Moors, who were being powdered by the
French gunners, rushed into the guns’ mouth with ‘Allah’ on their
lips, showed much the same type of courage. Only theirs was the
courage of desperation. Ambarish’s was due to love. Yet the Moorish
valour, readiness to die, conquered the gunners. They frantically
waved their hats, ceased firing and greeted their erstwhile enemies as
comrades. And so the South African passive resisters in their
thousands were ready to die rather than sell their honour for a little
personal ease. This was ahimsa in its active form. It never barters away
honour. A helpless girl in the hands of a follower of ahimsa finds
better and surer protection than in the hands of one who is prepared
to defend her only to the point to which his weapons would carry him.
The tyrant, in the first instance, will have to walk to his victim over the
dead body of her defender, in the second, he has but to overpower the
defender, for it is assumed that the canon of propriety in the second
instance will be satisfied when the defender has fought to the extent of
his physical valour. In the first instance, as the defender has matched
his very soul against the mere body of the tyrant, the odds are that the
soul in the latter will be awakened, and the girl will stand an infinitely
greater chance of her honour being protected than in any other
conceivable circumstance—barring, of course, that of her own
personal courage.
If we are unmanly today, we are so, not because we do not know
how to strike, but because we fear to die. He is no follower of
Mahavira, the apostle of Jainism, or of Buddha or of the Vedas, who
being afraid to die, takes flight before any danger, real or imaginary
all the while wishing that some body else would remove the danger by
destroying the person causing it. He is no follower of ahimsa (I agree
with Lalaji) who does not care a straw if he kills a man by inches by
deceiving him in trade, or who will protect by force of arms a few
cows and make away with the butcher, or who in order to do a

supposed good to his country does not mind killing off a few
officials. All these are actuated by hatred, cowardice and fear. Here
love of the cow or the country is a vague thing intended to satisfy
one’s vanity or soothe a stinging conscience.
Ahimsa, truly understood, is, in my humble opinion, apanacea
for all evils mundane and extra-mundane. We can never overdo it. Just
at present, we are not doing it at all. Ahimsa does not displace the
practice of other virtues, but renders their practice imperatively
necessary before it can be practised even in its rudiments. Lalaji need
not fear the ahimsa of his father’s faith. Mahavira and Buddha were
soldiers, and so was Tolstoy. Only they saw deeper and truer in their
profession, and found the secret of a true, happy, honourable and
godly life. Let us be joint sharers with these teachers and this land of
ours will once more be the abode of gods

192. THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF EDUCATION1
The word ‘education’ is on everyone’s lips these days. The
schools—whether Government or private—are packed with students.
There is not enough accommodation in colleges. A number of
students seeking admission to Gujarat College had to go back
disappointed. Despite this infatuation for education, hardly anyone
pauses to consider what education really is, whether the education we
have so far received has done us any good, or good commensurate
with the effort put in. We think as little about the meaning of
education, as about its aims and objects! For most people the main aim
seems to be to qualify for some kind of a job. Usually, people
belonging to different trades or vocations, on receiving this education,
give up their traditional modes of earning a livelihood and look
instead for jobs and, when they succeed, think that they have risen a
step higher. In our schools we find boys belonging to various
vocational communities such as masons, blacksmiths, carpenters,
tailors, cobblers, etc. But, on receiving education, instead of improving
the standards of their traditional vocations, they give them up as
1

Publishing House, Ahmedabad.

254

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

something inherently inferior and consider it an honour to become
clerks. The parents too share this false notion. Thus, disloyal both to
caste and to the functions most natural to us, we sink deeper into
slavery. During my tours, I found this condition prevailing
everywhere in India and it has often made my heart bleed.
Education is not an end in itself but only a means and that alone
can be called education which makes us men of character. No one can
claim that the education being given in our schools produces this
result. Rather, we shall come across many instances of young people
having dissipated their character while at school. An impartial English
writer has said that as long as there is no continuity between schools
and homes in India, the pupils will not have the benefit of either. Our
youths learn one thing from parents at home and from the general
environment, and another at school. The pattern at school is often
found incompatible with that in the home. The lessons in our readers
are regarded as of little relevance to conduct. We cannot put the
knowledge so acquired to any practical use in our daily life. The
parents are indifferent to what is taught at school. The labour spent on
studies is considered useless drudgery which has to be gone through
that one might take the final examination, and once this is over we
manage to forget as quickly as possible what we had studied. The
charge levelled against us by some Englishmen that we are mere
imitators is not entirely baseless. One of them, in his arrogance, has
likened us to blotting-paper in relation to civilization. He believes that
as blotting-paper absorbs the superfluous ink, even so we take in only
the superfluities, that is the evils of Western civilization. That, indeed,
we must admit, is our condition to some extent. Thinking about the
causes of this condition, I have come to the conclusion that the chief
fault lies in education being imparted to us through the medium of
English. It takes about twelve years to get the matriculation certificate.
We acquire precious little of knowledge over this long period. Our
main effort is not directed towards integrating any such knowledge
with our work and putting it to practical use, but towards gaining,
somehow, command of the English language. It has been stated by
experts that, if what has to be taught to the students up to the
matriculation class was imparted to them through their own mother
tongue, there would be a saving of at least five years. At this rate, on
ten thousand matriculates, the people are put to a loss of fifty
thousand years! This is a very grave situation. Not only that, we also
impoverish our own languages in this way. When I hear people say—
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

255

as they often do— that “Gujarati is a poor language”, it makes me
feel indignant. If Gujarati, a beloved daughter of Sanskrit, is poor, the
fault is not that of the language, but of ourselves who are its
guardians. We have neglected it and despised it. How can it then
acquire the lustre and strength which it ought to have? A gulf has
been created between us and our families. To our parents, to others in
our families, to our women, and to our domestics—with whom we live
for the greater part of our time—our school education is as some
hidden wealth. Its use is denied to them. It should be easy enough for
us to see that where conditions are so unnatural, the people can never
hope to rise. If we were not mere pieces of blotting-paper, after fifty
years of this education we should have witnessed a new spirit in our
masses. But we have no bond of understanding with them. They look
upon us as modernized and keep away from us and we look upon
them as an uncivilized lot and despise them.
Turning to higher education being imparted in colleges, we find
the same state of affairs. We waste a good deal of our time there,
seeking to put our knowledge on a surer foundation. We begin there
to grow indifferent to our own language. Many of us even develop a
feeling of contempt towards the mother tongue. We communicate with
one another in English, full of errors in pronunciation and grammar.
We have not yet coined in our own languages correct technical terms
for various sciences, and we do not fully understand the English
terms. By the time we have done with our college education, our
intelligence loses all vigour and our bodies their strength. The
medicine bottle becomes our life-long companion. And yet the
people think, and we too, that we are their ornament, their guardians
and the makers of their future.
If the young men of Gujarat who pass out of various colleges
seriously mean to become as guardians to the people, I should regard
them as brave. Although I have drawn a very gloomy picture of our
system of education, yet in this gloom lie seeds that may grow into
hope. I do not mean to suggest in this article that no Indian should
know English. Let us; do what they have done in Russia and what they
are doing in South Africa and Japan. In Japan, a few selected people
acquire a high knowledge of English, translate whatever is worth
importing from European civilization into their own language and so
make it accessible to all, thus saving the people from the useless
labour of having to learn English themselves. Quite a large number
among us are familiar with English. They may further increase their
256

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

knowledge of it. And those whose health allows it and whose mental
vigour is still intact may undertake to translate into Gujarati such ideas
from English and other foreign languages as are likely to do good to
our masses. If we strive long enough, we can change the present trend
of education and impart the knowledge of new sciences and new ideas
only through the medium of Gujarati. It is not impossible to impart
the knowledge of the sciences of medicine, navigation and electricity
through Gujarati. It is absurd to think that one can have a knowledge
of anatomy or perform an operation of bone surgery only after one
has acquired a knowledge of English.
Not less than eighty-five per cent of India’s population are
engaged in agriculture. Ten per cent are engaged in various other
crafts and a majority of them are weavers. The remaining five per cent
belong to the various professions. If these latter really desire to serve
the people, they must acquire some knowledge at least about the
occupations of the ninety-five per cent of the people. And it should
be the duty of the ninety-five per cent to acquire a proper knowledge
of their traditional occupations. If this view be correct, our schools
must provide for the teaching of these two occupations—agriculture
and weaving —to the pupils from childhood onwards. In order to
create the right conditions for imparting a good knowledge of
agriculture and weaving, all our schools should be located, not in the
densely populated parts of towns or cities, but in places where big
farms may be developed and where classes may be conducted in the
open air. In such schools, sports for the boys will consist in ploughing
the fields. The idea that, if our boys and youths do not have football,
cricket and such other games, their life should become too drab is
completely erroneous. The sons of our peasants never get a chance to
play cricket, but there is no dearth of joy or innocent zest in their life.
Thus, it is not difficult to change the present trends in education.
Public opinion must be in favour of this change. The Government
then will have no option but to introduce changes. ‘Those who like
the above scheme should come forward to undertake experiments on
these lines while public opinion is in the making. When the people see
the happy results of these experiments, they will of their own accord
want to take them up. I think such experiments will not entail much
expenditure. I have not, however, written this article with a commercial
mentality. My chief object was to ask readers to consider the meaning
of real education and I shall hold my effort to have been duly
rewarded if this article is of any help to them.

193. THE HINDU CASTE SYSTEM1
The Hindu social structure has endured, I believe, on the
foundation of the caste system. Sir William Hunter says in his History
of India that, thanks to the continuing existence of the institution of
caste, there has been no need for any law for the poor (pauper law) in
India. This seems to me a sound view. The caste system contains
within it the seed of swaraj. The different castes are so many divisions
of an army. The general does not know the soldiers individually but
gets them to work through the respective captains. In like manner, we
can carry out social reform with ease through the agency of the caste
system and order through it our religious, practical and moral affairs
as we choose.
The caste system is a perfectly natural institution. In our
country, it has been invested with a religious meaning; elsewhere, its
utility was not fully realized and so it remained a mere form, with the
result that the countries concerned did not derive much benefit from
it. These being my views, I am opposed to the movements which are
being carried on for the destruction of the system.
However, any defects in the caste system which we may find
must certainly be removed and for that purpose we must first study
its real nature. As I pointed out earlier, we have given a religious
meaning to the system. It is merely an agency for ensuring selfcontrol. The caste defines the limits within which one may enjoy life;
that is to say, we are not free to seek any happiness outside the caste.
We do not associate with members of other communities for eating or
enter into marriage relationships with them. With an arrangement of
this kind, there is a good chance that loose conduct will be kept down.
The idea that coming together for purposes of eating promotes
friendship is contradicted by experience. If it did, the great war being
waged today in Europe would never have started. The bitterest
quarrels are among relatives. We have needlessly exaggerated the
importance of eating. The process of eating is as unclean as
evacuation, the only difference being that, while evacuation ends in a
sense of relief, eating, if one’s tongue is not held in control, brings
1

its issue of October, 1916.

258

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

discomfort. Just as we attend to evacuation, etc., in private, we should
likewise eat and perform other actions common to all animals always
in private. The purpose of eating is to sustain the body. If this
statement is correct, obviously, the less ostentation we make about it,
the better.
The same thing is true of marriage. Prohibition of marriage with
anyone not belonging to one’s community promotes self-control, and
self-control is conducive to happiness in all circumstances. The larger
the area over which the net is cast, the greater the risk. That is the
reason why I see nothing wrong in the practice of choosing the
husband or the wife from among persons of equal birth. Even in
countries where class differentiation does not rest on religion, they
guard against hybrid unions. This is the meaning of the phrase ‘blue
blood’ in England. Lord Salisbury1 used to boast that he belonged to
the same stock as Elizabeth. It was a fact which seemed to him and the
British people worth being proud of.
In this way, the restrictions in regard to eating and marriage are,
as a general rule, wholesome. There is, of course, and there will always
be, room for exceptions. This has been accepted by Hindu society,
whether it knows the fact or not. Rightly considered, however, there
are no exceptions. If I eat in the company of a Bhangi 2 , there being,
from my point of view, greater self-control in doing so, the
community should have nothing to do in the matter. Or, if I fail to get
a suitable bride from my own community and I am likely, if I remain
unmarried, to contract vicious habits, it will, in these circumstances, be
an act of self-control on my part to marry a girl of my choice from
any community and hence my action will not be a violation of the
fundamental principle of the caste system. It would be for me to
demonstrate that my purpose in taking such a step in disregard of the
general rule was discipline of the flesh, and this would appear from
my subsequent conduct. Meanwhile? however, I should not resent
being denied the usual privileges that go with membership of a
community but ought to continue doing my duty by it.
The caste system has other laws besides those relating to eating
and marriage. It has, ready at hand, the means for providing primary
education. Every community can make its own arrangements for
[such] education. It has machinery for election to the Swaraj Sabha

(Parliament). Every community with some standing may elect its own
representatives. It has ready provision for arbitration and tribunals to
solve disputes. Each community should itself resolve disputes among
its own members. If it becomes necessary to raise an army for war, we
have already as many battalions as we have communities. The caste
system has struck such deep roots in India that I think it will be far
more advisable to try to improve it, rather than uproot it. Some may
argue that, if these views about the caste system are right, one will have
to admit that the more numerous the communities, the better it would
be, and that, if that came about, every ten persons would form a
community. There is no substance in this argument. The rise and
disappearance of communities does not depend upon the will of
particular individuals or groups. In Hindu society, communities have
been formed, have disappeared and have gone through improvements
according to the needs of the times and the process is taking place
even today, visibly or invisibly. The Hindu caste system is not merely
an inert, lifeless institution but a living one and has been functioning
according to its own law. Unfortunately, today we find it full of evils
like ostentation and hypocrisy, pleasure seeking and quarrels. But this
only proves that people lack character; we cannot conclude from it
that the system itself is bad.

195. SPEECH AT BOMBAY PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE,
AHMEDABAD1
October 21, 1916
I am grateful to the Reception Committee for giving me this
privilege of proposing the election of the President today. When I was
in Delhi some days ago, I happened to read a Persian couplet in the
beautiful Divan-e-Am and Divan-e-Khas there2 . The couplet means ;
“If there is a paradise anywhere on this earth, it is here, it is here, it is
here.” The thoughts which the couplet aroused in me then revive in
my mind as I move this proposal. The words proceeded from the
pride of kingly power and wealth. There can be no such paradise on
this earth, because in the course of time even that place is bound to be
destroyed. If, however, we turn to good use this occasion of our
meeting, we may some time get into the paradise that is invisible. It is
a matter of no little pride for us that moderate and extremist leaders
have met together today. India is a country situated in the temperate
zone. We desire that this conference should give birth to a temperate
party which would secure for us all that we demand. Ahmedabad is a
commercial city and it is but natural that its business acumen should
be manifest in every undertaking. It has chosen as President a person
who holds a respected position in the eyes of both parties. It decided
accordingly that it would be in the fitness of things to elect as
President a learned Muslim gentleman. This is not for the first time
that Ahmedabad has shown such wisdom. It has done so on many
previous occasions. Our President, Mr. Jinnah, is an eminent lawyer;
he is not only a member of the Legislature but also the President of
the biggest Islamic Association in India. He has placed us under a
great obligation by accepting the presidentship of this small
conference. All of you must have rejoiced at it as much as I have
done. We should feel, in regard to all, that they belong to us. The
feeling which we outwardly show, that moderates or extermists, Surtis
or Kathiawaris or Ahmedabadis, Hindus or Muslims, all are our
brethren, should be there in our hearts, Muslims and others will then
be so enslaved by our love that there will be no need to establish
societies for the protection of animals. Instead, our Muslim brethren

will of their own accord put a stop to animal slaughter in
consideration of the religious susceptibilities of their Hindu brethren.
If we develop such feeling, this occasion, indeed the whole movement,
will yield the expected result as a matter of course. I know the
President’s job is like walking on the edge of a sword; let him utilize
to the full the advantages he enjoys in virtue of the important position
which he occupies. I pray to God to grant him the necessary strength,
wisdom and ability to guide the work of this conference.

196. SPEECH ON DEFENCE OF INDIA ACT
October 22, 1916
At the Bombay Provincial Conference held in Ahmedabad, Gandhiji moved, on
October 22, 1916, the following resolution:

That this Conference views with deep concern and alarm the
working of the Defence of India Act as exemplified in the recent cases
of Mrs. Besant and others and strongly urges upon Government the
immediate necessity of providing in connection with the Defence of
India Act the same safeguards as exist in England in relation to the
Defence of the Realm Act. It respectfully requests that Government
may also be pleased to cancel at an early date the order prohibiting
Mrs. Annie Besant from entering the limits of this Presidency.
Speaking in Gujarati, Mr. Gandhi said he thought the only thing Mrs. Besant
seemed to have done was that she had been actively conducting the Home Rule
agitation in India, and if that was the reason why the Bombay Government had
prohibited her, then their late Viceroy Lord Hardinge was equally liable to be
prohibited from entering the Presidency because it was His Lordship who had first
raised this question. Apart from that, there were three other grounds on which they
should stand by Mrs. Besant, viz., gallantry, pity, and self-interest. Government had,
as it were, laid its hands on a lady and, as a nation noted for chivalry, they should do
all they could do to remove the indignity. Then there was the question of pity. They
felt pity for Government because, with all its powers to bring the offending person to
justice under the existing laws, it had found it necessary to resort to this measure
against a lady. Lastly, the question of self-interest lay in the fact that they wanted
Mrs. Besant in their Presidency because nobody could carry on the agitation better

262

than she. The fact that no reason was given for the Government order was significant.
He warmly commended the resolution for acceptance.

198. RESOLUTION ON INDENTURE SYSTEM,
AHMEDABAD
October 23, 1916
On 23rd October, 1916, the third and concluding day of the Bombay
Provincial Conference at Ahmedabad, Gandhiji moved the following resolution:

That this Conference strongly urges the necessity of abolition of
the indenture system as early as possible, the system being a form of
slavery which socially and politically debases labourers and is
seriously detrimental to the economic and moral interests of the
country.
Mr. Gandhi, in moving the resolution, spoke in Gujarati explaining the
various difficulties existing at present.

199. SPEECH ON VIRAMGAM CUSTOMS CORDON1
October 23, 1916
Gandhiji moved the following resolution:

This Conference brings to the special notice of Government the
inconvenience, hardship and annoyance caused to persons coming
from Kathiawar into British territory by levy of customs duties and
especially by the stringency of the rules and the manner of their
enforcement for such levy at the Viramgam Railway station and at
other stations which border on Gujarat and earnestly prays for the
removal of the levy at an early date.2
Moving the resolution, Gandhiji said:

The people of Kathiawar are under the authority of two
governments. They are subjects of Indian Princes and the latter
are subject to the authority of the British Government. The idea
behind the levy was to prevent the smuggling of goods from foreign
countries. Since arrangements for that purpose exist at the ports, why
should the people have to bear this tax? A petition was made by Shri
Gokuldas against the customs levy at Ranpur This levy is a source of

200. LETTER TO AJIT PRASAD
AHMEDABAD ,

November 1, 1916
DEAR MR. AJIT PRASAD,

I well remember having met you at Bombay.
I took action about Pandit Arjan Lal in the early part of the year
but I understood then that the Government had positive proof in their
possession of a damaging nature. Since then I have become
lukewarm. I would like to discuss the matter further with you before
taking further steps. I know the argument that we ask not for an
unconditional discharge but for a proper trial. The most effective
appeal can however be based only on real innocence of the party
concerned. If I come to Lucknow during the Congress meet, we shall
discuss the whole matter.
Yours sincerely,

M. K. GANDHI

202. SPEECH ON RAJCHANDRA JAYANTI, WADHWAN2
November 9, 1916
Shrimad [Rajchandra] led his life in a spirit of the highest
detachment. There are two classes of people in this meeting. In one
class are those who look upon Shrimad Rajchandra with a feeling of
devotion; and in the other those who are here only as spectators at a
show. Whether or not this jayanti will be successfully celebrated
depends essentially on the former. Those who revere Shrimad should
show this reverence in their own dealings. If the followers of Shrimad
show themselves virtuous in their behaviour, that would have a great
effect on society. Religion rests on conduct. If you can improve your
manner of living, you will be able to improve society. Shrimad has
had a profound influence on me. I would, therefore, say to his
followers that Shrimad’s name is in their hands. They should emulate,
in the right spirit, the ideals and the conduct of Shrimad. Otherwise, an
element of hypocrisy will creep into such jayanti celebrations. Strive
as much as you can to avoid being hypocritical. If there is a true
feeling of devotion in them, those who are here as mere spectators will
go back infected by it. The success of a jayanti celebration depends

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I am today in an out-of-the-way place. I had your doleful letter.
You have lost nothing and therefore you have gained nothing. That
there has been loss in your affairs is no virtue of yours. You would
have prevented the loss if you could have. I appreciate your anxiety to
be and feel totally independent before you can live in comfort with
me.
All I say is when the agony of the war is over, you will first
hasten here and then arrange your programme. That is what I shall
hope and pray for. Polak is due any day now. When he arrives I shall
confer with him and write to you fully. Meanwhile let this be your
comfort. The loss that millions have sustained is nothing compared to
yours.2 And a man’s worth is tried not in his prosperity but adversity.
Do therefore cheer up.
With deep love,

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I cannot get rid of illness from the Ashram. I am making
experiments but they do not answer completely. The slightest
indulgence tells upon the boys. Naicker, Purshottam (a new boy),
Parthasarathy and Ramdas are down and so is Anna’s wife. Anna is
the Tamil friend who has joined the Ashram. They are most of them
down with fever. This is the fever season, but we ought to be immune.
This illness taxes me much. The introduction of the Pariah family had
already put an undue strain on me and now comes the sickness.
However we make merry and go on. Only I should like you to be with
me on such occasions. But what are we when we consider the
thousands who are just now separated! We must make the best of it
and exercise the patience of a Job.
The new bookcase is ready and is a complete success. It looks
strong and decent. It is easily portable. Sivpujan and Coopoo have
been at it. Evidently you too will be learning cabinet-making there in
a way you would not have done elsewhere. Your experiences will all
be useful in later life.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

So, this will reach you in your new surroundings. You are
having the richest experiences of your life. Those of us who are
unwilling spectators of this mighty tragedy may, if we will, learn the
true lesson of life. You say you have lost during these two years.1 I am
sure you will not have when we come to the end of it all. You have
never wanted to live an aimless and selfish life. Those who want to
find happiness in realizing essential oneness of all life, as I know you
do, cannot fail to gain a great deal from the experiences such as you
are having. Anyway all you learnt is now being tested in a manner
least expected by you or me. But do not worry over your South
African affairs. It will be time to do so when the war is over. Your next
few letters will now be my special care. Remember ‘Lead Kindly
Light’. Lay stress upon ‘one step enough for me’. It is not given to
us to peep into the future. If we but take care of the present, the future
will take care of itself.
All but Polak, a member, and I have gone a picknicking today.
It is a Sunday and it is at the present moment about 4 p.m. This is our

206. LETTER TO A. H. WEST
AHMEDABAD ,

December 12, 1916
MY DEAR WEST,

This is not the draft letter that Polak refers to in his letter to you
herewith. But what I am now saying is in substance what is in the draft
letter.
We have all thought over your proposal and feel that we can no
longer rely upon support from the P. R. fund. The Phoenix trustees
are not all agreed upon the support being so received. The Committee
here will at the most just tolerate the withdrawal of fund[s] for
sustaining Indian Opinion. And the public there will also look upon
such support with strong disfavour. In the circumstances, we can only
fall back upon local support or failing that reduce the paper to any
extent we choose. In this matter you should have absolute control. By
you, I mean you, Devi1 and Sam 2 and anyone who may be sent from
here.
I observe that Pragji must now leave. He wants to. Bhaga
too goes. Chhaganlal is ready to come over and work under you
loyally. Or if you will not shoulder the responsibility, he will work the
paper with your loyal co-operation. I do hope you will agree to
Chhaganlal’s return. If you don’t, Chhaganlal will come with his
family to work on the same terms as above. And if you do not favour
Maganlal’s return, Manilal and Ramdas can be sent. They of course
can only work under your directions. Manilal should find no
difficulty in gradually editing the Gujarati part. For the time being, he
will simply translate what you want him to.
If you favour Chhaganlal’s return, cable simply ‘Chhaganlal’
and I shall know. If you want Maganlal, cable simply ‘Maganlal’.
And if you want Manilal and Ramdas, cable simply ‘Manilal’. If you
want only Manilal, you may cable ‘Manilal without Ramdas’.
I shall write later about the accounts. We do not need to publish

with the balance. Transvaal Indian Women’s Association funds are not
with me. They are in the balance with you. Even if you disagree, you
should bank the amount due separately in consultation with Miss
Schlesin and hand the receipt to her. They want it banked to bear
interest. And they are right.
Polak has gone to Madras. I am preparing for the Congress. I
want to write on many matters, not about the press or Phoenix. But
this must wait till after my return from Lucknow.
I wrote 1 to Pragji when he told me that you all did not want
Chhaganlal, that I would not send him. So said Polak too. But after
consultation with Chhaganlal and examining the situation here, I came
to the conclusion that I must at least let you know it and let you
decide one way or the other.

I have two letters from you together. I hope that by the time this
reaches you, uncertainty about your fate will have vanished and that
you would feel settled so far as it is possible to feel like that in these
times. You have added up your gains and losses. It is a difficult task.
We often deceive ourselves and what may appear to be losses may be
gains in reality and vice versa. The measure of progress is the measure
of resistance to temptations. The world may judge us by a single fall.
But we might in spite thereof have risen if we have resisted numerous
temptations previous to the fall and after the fall we are conscious of it
and sincerely desirous of retracing the steps. To count losses and

tomorrow from Madras. Manilal and Ramdas will be soon with me, as
they will be going to South Africa to help West. I think I have already
informed you of this move. Of the four boys I shall therefore have
only Devdas.

Dr. Hill proposed the Hon. Pandit Malaviya to the chair and welcomed Mr.
Gandhi in their midst.
The Hon. Pandit Malaviya in introducing Mr. Gandhi said that his was a name
honoured throughout India and wherever Indians lived. His name was
also appreciated by a large number of Europeans who understood his character.
It was always an instruction to him to read of the work he had done and of the life he
had led.
Mr. Gandhi then delivered the following lecture:

When I accepted Mr. Kapildeva Malaviya’s invitation to speak to
you upon the subject of this evening, I was painfully conscious of my
limitations. You are an economic society. You have chosen
distinguished specialists for the subjects included in your syllabus for
this year and the next. I seem to be the only speaker ill-fitted for the
task set before him. Frankly and truly, I know very little of economics,
as you naturally understand them. Only the other day, sitting at an
evening meal, a civilian friend deluged me with a series of questions
on my crankisms. As he proceeded in his cross-examination, I being a
willing victim, he found no difficulty in discovering my gross
ignorance of the matters. I appeared to him to be handling with a
cocksureness worthy only of a man who knows not that he knows not.
To his horror and even indignation, I suppose, he found that I had not
even read books on economics by such well-known authorities as Mill,
Marshall, Adam Smith and a host of such other authors. In despair, he
ended by advising me to read these works before experimenting in
matters economic at the expense of the public. He little knew that I
was a sinner past redemption. My experiments continue at the expense
of trusting friends. For, there come to us moments in life when about
some things we need no proof from without. A little voice within us
tells us, “You are on the right track, move neither to your left nor
right, but keep to the straight and narrow way.” With such help we
march forward slowly indeed, but surely and steadily. That is my
position. It may be satisfactory enough for me, but it can in no way
answer the requirements of a society such as yours. Still it was no use
my struggling against Mr. Kapildeva Malaviya. I knew that he was
intent upon having me to engage your attention for one of your
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

273

evenings. Perhaps you will treat my intrusion as a welcome diversion
from the trodden path. An occasional fast after a series of sumptuous
feasts is often a necessity. And as with the body, so, I imagine, is the
case with the reason. And if your reason this evening is found fasting
instead of feasting, I am sure it will enjoy with the greater avidity the
feast that Rao Bahadur Pandit Chandrika Prasad has in store for you
for the 12th of January.
Before I take you to the field of my experiences and
experiments, it is perhaps best to have a mutual understanding about
the title of this evening’s address: Does economic progress clash with
real progress? By economic progress, I take it, we mean material
advancement without limit and by real progress we mean moral
progress, which again is the same thing as progress of the permanent
element in us. The subject may therefore be stated thus: “Does not
moral progress increase in the same proportion as material progress?”
I know that this is a wider proposition than the one before us. But I
venture to think that we always mean the larger one even when we lay
down the smaller. For we know enough of science to realise that there
is no such thing as perfect rest or repose in this visible universe of
ours. If therefore material progress does not clash with moral
progress, it must necessarily advance the latter. Nor can we be satisfied
with the clumsy way in which sometimes those who cannot defend the
larger proposition put their case. They seem to be obsessed with the
concrete case of thirty millions of India stated by the late Sir William
Wilson Hunter to be living on one meal a day. They say that before we
can think or talk of their moral welfare, we must satisfy their daily
wants. With these, they say, material progress spells moral progress.
And then is taken a sudden jump: what is true of thirty millions is true
of the universe. They forget that hard cases make bad law. I need
hardly say to you how ludicrously absurd this deduction would be.
No one has ever suggested that grinding pauperism can lead to
anything else than moral degradation. Every human being has a right
to live and therefore to find the wherewithal to feed himself and where
necessary to clothe and house himself. But, for this very simple
performance, we need no assistance from economists or their laws.
“Take no thought for the morrow” 1 is an injuction which finds
an echo in almost all the religious scriptures of the world. In
1

274

St. Matthew, VI, 34
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

well-ordered society, the securing of one’s livelihood should be and is
found to be the easiest thing in the world. Indeed, the test of
orderliness in a country is not the number of millionaires it owns, but
the absence of starvation among its masses. The only statement that
has to be examined is whether it can be laid down as a law of universal
application that material advancement means moral progress.
Now let us take a few illustrations. Rome suffered a moral
fall when it attained high material affluence. So did Egypt and so
perhaps most countries of which we have any historic record. The
decendants, kinsmen of the royal and divine Krishna, too, fell when
they were rolling in riches. We do not deny to the Rockefellers and
the Carnegies possession of an ordinary measure of morality but
we gladly judge them indulgently. I mean that we do not even expect
them to satisfy the highest standard of morality. With them material
gain has not necessarily meant moral gain. In South Africa, where I
had the privilege of associating with thousands of our countrymen on
most intimate terms, I observed almost invariably that the greater the
possession of riches, the greater was their moral turpitude. Our rich
men, to say the least, did not advance the moral struggle of passive
resistance as did the poor. The rich men’s sense of self-respect was not
so much injured as that of the poorest. If I were not afraid of treading
on dangerous ground, I would even come nearer home and show you
that possession of riches has been a hindrance to real growth. I
venture to think that the scriptures of the world are far safer and
sounder treatises on laws of economics than many of the modern
text-books. The question we are asking ourselves this evening is not a
new one. It was addressed to Jesus two thousand years ago. St. Mark1
has vividly described the scene. Jesus is in his solemn mood; he is
earnest. He talks of eternity. He knows the world about him. He is
himself the greatest economist of his time. He succeeded in
economising time and space—he transcended them. It is to him at his
best that one comes running, kneels down, and asks: “Good Master,
what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said unto
him: “Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is
God. Thou knowest the commandments. Do not commit adultery, Do
not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour
thy father and mother.” And he answered and said unto him:
“Master, all these have I observed from my youth.” Then Jesus
1

Ch. X, verses 17-31

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

275

beholding him, loved him and said unto him: “One thing thou
lackest. Go thy way, sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor, and
thou shalt have treasure in heaven—come take up the cross and follow
me.” And he was sad at that saying and went away grieved—for he
had great possessions. And Jesus looked round about and said unto
his disciples: “How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the
kingdom of God.” And the disciples were astonished at his words.
But Jesus answereth again and saith unto them: “Children, how hard it
is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kindgom of God. It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter into the kingdom of God !” Here you have an eternal
rule of life stated in the noblest words the English language is capable
of producing. But the disciples nodded unbelief as we do even to this
day. To him they said as we say today: “But look how the law fails in
practice. If we sell all and have nothing, we shall have nothing to eat.
We must have money or we cannot even be reasonably moral.” So
they state their case thus. “And they were astonished out of measure
saying among themselves: ‘Who then can be saved?’” And Jesus
looking upon them saith: “With men it is impossible but not with
God, for with God all things are possible.” Then Peter began to say
unto him: “Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.” And Jesus
answered and said: “Verily I say unto you there is no man that has
left house or brethren or sisters; or father or mother, or wife or
children or lands for my sake and the Gospels, but he shall receive
one hundred fold, now in this time houses and brethren and sisters
and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the
world to come eternal life. But many that are first shall be last and the
last first.” You have here the result or reward, if you prefer the term,
of following the law. I have not taken the trouble of copying similar
passages from the other non Hindu scriptures and I will not insult you
by quoting in support of the law stated by Jesus passages from the
writings and sayings of our own sages, passages even stronger if
possible than the Biblical extracts I have drawn your attention to.
Perhaps the strongest of all the testimonies in favour of the affirmative
answer to the question before us are the lives of the greatest teachers
of the world. Jesus, Mahomed, Buddha, Nanak, Kabir, Chaitanya,
Shankara, Dayanand, Ramakrishna were men who exercised an
immense influence over and moulded the character of thousands of
men. The world is the richer for their having lived in it. And they were
all men who deliberately embraced poverty as their lot.
276

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

I should not have laboured my point as I have done, if I did
not believe that, in so far as we have made the modern materialistic
craze our goal, in so far are we going downhill in the path of progress.
I hold that economic progress in the sense I have put it is antagonistic
to real progress. Hence the ancient ideal has been the limitation of
activities promoting wealth. This does not put an end to all material
ambition. We should still have, as we have always had, in our midst
people who make the pursuit of wealth their aim in life. But we have
always recognised that it is a fall from the ideal. It is a beautiful thing
to know that the wealthiest among us have often felt that to have
remained voluntarily poor would have been a higher state for them.
That you cannot serve God and Mammon is an economic truth of the
highest value. We have to make our choice. Western nations today are
groaning under the heel of the monster-god of materialism. Their
moral growth has become stunted. They measure their progress in £.
s. d. American wealth has become the standard. She [sic] is the envy
of the other nations. I have heard many of our countrymen say that
we will gain American wealth but avoid its methods. I venture to
suggest that such an attempt if it were made is foredoomed to failure.
We cannot be ‘wise, temperate and furious’ 1 in a moment. I would
have our leaders to teach us to be morally supreme in the world. This
land of ours was once, we are told, the abode of the gods. It is not
possible to conceive gods inhabiting a land which is made hideous by
the smoke and the din of null chimneys and factories and whose
roadways are traversed by rushing engines dragging numerous cars
crowded with men mostly who know not what they are after, who are
often absent-minded, and whose tempers do not improve by being
uncomfortably packed like sardines in boxes and finding themselves
in the midst of utter strangers who would oust them if they could and
whom they would in their turn oust similarly. I refer to these things
because they are held to be symbolical of material progress. But they
add not an atom to our happiness. This is what Wallace, the great
scientist, has said as his deliberate Judgement.
In the earliest records which have come down to us from the past, we
find ample indications that general ethical considerations and conceptions,
the accepted standard of morality, and the conduct resulting from these were in
no degree inferior to those which prevail to-day.

In a series of chapters, he then proceeds to examine the position
of the English nation under the advance in wealth it has made. He
says:
This rapid growth of wealth and increase of our power over nature put
too great a strain upon our crude civilization, on our superficial Christianity,
and it was accompanied by various forms of social immorality almost as
amazing and unprecedented.

He then shows how factories have risen on the corpses of men,
women and children, how as the country has rapidly advanced in
riches, it has gone down in morality. He shows this by dealing with
insanitation, life-destroying trades, adulteration, bribery and
gambling. He shows how, with the advance of wealth, justice has
become immoral, deaths from alcoholism and suicide have increased.
the average of premature births and congenital defects has increased,
and prostitution has become an institution. He concludes his
examination by these pregnant remarks:
The proceedings of the divorce courts show other aspects of the
result of wealth and leisure, while a friend who had been good deal inLondon
society assured me that both in country houses and in London various kinds of
orgies were occasionally to be met with which would hardly have been
surpassed in the period of the most dissolute emperors. Of war, too, I need say
nothing. It has always been more or less chronic since the rise of the Roman
Empire; but there is now undoubtedly a disinclination for war among all
civilized peoples. Yet the vast burden of armaments, taken together with the
most pious declarations in favour of peace, must be held to show an almost
total absence of morality as a guiding principle among the governing classes.

Under the British aegis, we have learnt much, but it is my firm
belief that there is little to gain from Britain in intrinsic morality, that
if we are not careful, we shall introduce all the vices that she has been
a prey to, owing to the disease of materialism. We can profit by that
connection only if we keep our civilization, and our morals, straight,
i.e., if instead of boasting of the glorious past, we express the ancient
moral glory in our own lives and let our lives bear witness to our past.
Then we shall benefit her and ourselves. If we copy her because she
provides us with rulers, both they and we shall suffer degradation. We
need not be afraid of ideals or of reducing them to practice even to
the uttermost. Ours will only then be a truly spiritual nation when we
shall show more truth than gold, greater fearlessness than pomp of
power and wealth, greater charity than love of self. If we will but clean

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

town houses, our palaces and temples of the attributes of wealth and
show in them the attributes of morality, we can offer battle to any
combinations of hostile forces without having to carry the burden of a
heavy militia. Let us seek first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness and the irrevocable promise is that everything will be
added with us. These are real economics. May you and I treasure
them and enforce them in our daily life.
An interesting discussion followed in the course of which several students put
questions to the lecturer. . . .
Prof. Jevons said . . . . It was necessary for economists to exist. It was not
their business to lay down what the end should be. That was the business of
philosophers. . . .
Prof. Gidwani, president of the society, thanked the lecturer for his
address. . . .
Prof. Higginbottom said that there was no economic problem which could be
separated from the moral problem. .
Mr. Gandhi in the course of his remarks referred to Mr. Jevons’
remark about the need for economist and said that it was said that dirt was matter
misplaced. So also when an economist was misplaced, he was hurtful. He certainly
thought that the economist had a place in the economy of nature when he occupied the
humble sphere for which he was created. If an economist did not investigate the laws
of God and show them how to distribute wealth so that there might not be poverty, he
was a most unwelcome intrusion on the Indian soil. He would also suggest for the
reflection of their economic students and professors that what might be good for
England and America need not necessarily be good for India. He thought that most of
the economic laws which were consistent with moral laws were of universal
application, but there might be in their restricted application some distinction and
difference. So he would utter the note of warning that Indian conditions being in some
respects so essentially different from the English and American conditions, it was
necessary to bring to bear on the matters that presented themselves to the economists
a fresh mind. If they did so, both Indians and the economists would derive benefit.
Mr. Higginbottom, he said, was studying the real economics that were so necessary
for India and reducing his studies inch by inch to practice and that was the safest guide
to follow, whether they were students or professors. Referring to a question by a
student, he said that a man should not hoard money for selfish ends, but if he wished
to hoard money as a trustee for the millions of India, he would say that he might have
as much riches as he could. Ordinarily, economists prescribed laws for the rich
people. It was against those economists that he would always cry out.
As regards another question, whether factories should not be replaced by
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

279

cottage industries, Mr. Gandhi spoke approvingly of the suggestion but said that the
economists should first of all examine with patience their indigenous institutions. If
they were rotten, they must be wiped but and if there were remedies which could be
suggested for their betterment, they should improve them.
As regards intercourse with other nations, he said that he did not think that
they necessarily advanced one little bit in their moral growth by bringing their
masses with others into physical contact and pointed to Indians in South Africa as an
instance. The rapid locomotion such as steamers, trains and others dislocated so
many of their ideals and created a great deal of mischief.
As regards the question what was the minimum and the maximum wealth a man
should have—he would answer in the words of Jesus, Ramkrishna and others who said
‘none’.
The Hon. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya in his concluding remarks offered a
cordial vote of thanks to Mr. Gandhi for his excellent address. The ideals which Mr.
Gandhi put before them, he said, were so high that he did not expect that all of them
would be prepared to subscribe to all of them. But he was sure they would agree with
the main object he put before them, namely, that they should go for the welfare of
man as the test of all economic questions with which they dealt. . . .

209. SPEECH AT ALLAHABAD ON EDUCATION,
ANCIENT AND MODERN
December 23, 1916
Mr. Gandhi addressed in Hindi a public meeting at Allahabad at Munshi Ram
Prasad’s garden under the chairmanship of the Hon. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya.
The gathering was a record one even for Munshi Ram Prasad’s garden where some of
the largest public meetings have been held.
Mr. Gandhi, who on rising was greeted with loud and prolonged cheers, said
that that he should have felt difficulty—of which he was ashamed—in addressing the
meeting in Hindi, was a striking commentary on the system of modern education
which was a part of the subject of his lecture that evening. He would, however, prefer
to speak in Hindi although he had greater facility of expression in English.
Describing the modern system of education, he said that real education was considered
to have begun at the college at the age of 16 or 17. The education received in school
was not useful. For instance, an Indian student, while he knew well the geography of
England, did not possess a sufficient knowledge of the geography of his own country.
This history of India which they were taught was greatly distorted. Government

280

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

service was the aim of their education. Their highest ambition was to become
members of the Imperial Legislative Council. The boys abandoned their hereditary
occupations, and forsook their mother tongue. They were adopting the English
language, European ideas and European dress. They thought in English, conducted all
their political and social work and all commercial transactions, etc., in English and
thought that they could not do without the English language. They had come to think
that there was no other road. Education through English had created a wide gulf
between the educated few and the masses. It had created a gulf in the families also. An
English-educated man had no community of feelings and ideas with the ladies of his
family. And, as had been said, the aspirations of the English-educated men were fixed
on Government service and at the most on membership of the Imperial Legislative
Council. He for one could never commend a system of education which produced such
a state of things and men educated under such system could not be expected to do any
great service to the country. Mr. Gandhi did not mean that the English-educated
leaders did not feel for the masses. On the other hand, he acknowledged that the
Congress and other great public movements were initiated and conducted by them.
But, at the same time, he could not help feeling that the work done during all these
years would have been much more and much greater progress would have been made if
they had been taught in their mother tongue. It was unfortunate, said the speaker, that
a feeling had come over them that there was no path to progress other than that which
I was being followed. They found themselves helpless. But it was not manliness to
assume all attitude of helplessness.
Mr. Gandhi then described the ancient system of education and said that even
elementary education imparted by the village teacher taught the student all that was
necessary for their occupations. Those who went in for higher education became fully
conversant with the science of wealth, Artha Shastra, ethics and religion, Dharma
Shastra. In ancient times, there were no restrictions on education. It was not
controlled by the State but was solely in the hands of the Brahmins who shaped the
system of education solely with an eye to the welfare of the people. It was based on
restraint and brahmacharya. It was due to such a system of education that Indian
civilization had outlived so many vicissitudes through thousands of years, while such
ancient civilizations as those of Greece, Rome and Egypt had become extinct. No
doubt the wave of a new civilization had been passing through India. But he was sure
that it was transitory, it would soon pass away and Indian civilization would be
revivified. In ancient times, the basis of life was self-restraint but now it was
enjoyment. The result was that people had become powerless cowards and forsook the
truth. Having come under the influence of another civilization, it might be necessary
to adapt our own civilization in certain respects to our new environment but we
should not make any radical change in a civilization which was acknowledged even
by some western scholars to be the best. It might be urged that it was necessary to
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

281

adopt the methods and instruments of western civilization to meet the material forces
of that civilization. But the forces born of spirituality, the bedrock of Indian
civilization, were more than a match for material forces. India was pre-eminently the
land of religion. It was the first and the last duty of Indians to maintain it as such.
They should draw their strength from the soul, from God. If they adhered to that path,
swarajya which they were aspiring to and working for would become their handmaid.

210. SPEECH AT LUCKNOW CONGRESS
December 28, 1916
Mr. M. K. Gandhi (Bombay) moving Resolution No. IX on “Indentured
Labour” on 28th December 1916 at the 31st Indian National Congress Session held at
Lucknow said:
MR. PRESIDENT, BROTHER-DELEGATES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

I notice that there is an appeal made to me by my Tamil
brethren that I should speak to them in English and I am
going partly to accede to their importunity, but I want to
make an appeal in return that during the next year if they
do not learn the lingua franca, which I know will be the
lingua franca (“Hear, hear”), when swaraj is granted to the
whole of India, if you do not do so during the ensuing year,
you will do so at your peril, so far as I am concerned.
(Cheers.) I shall read the resolution in English, which I
propose to read afterwards in Hindi also. The resolution
runs as follows: (a) This Congress strongly urges that
indentured emigration should be stopped by prohibiting the
recruitment of such labour within the ensuing year.
(b) In the opinion of this Congress, it is highly desirable that at
least one representative Indian selected after consultation
with associations voicing Indian public opinion be
appointed by the Government of India to take part in the
forthcoming inter-departmental Conference to be held in
London for the consideration of this question.
(c) This Congress earnestly requests that the reports of Mr.
Marjoribanks and Hon’ble Mr. Thambi Marakkyar and of
the inter-departmental Committee be published for general
282

information and discussion before any action is taken
thereupon.
The pressmen and the delegates who have copies of the
resolution with them will kindly note that there is a verbal alteration in
clause (a), that instead of the word “during”, the resolution will read
“within”. It is made at the instance of a friend who is afraid that the
Government might consider that we would be satisfied if indentured
emigration was suspended during the ensuing year, whereas our
meaning is that it should be abolished for ever. In clause (b) also, you
will note that there is an addition of the word “Indian” before the
words “public opinion”.
Mr. Gandhi read the resolution in Hindi and explained the object of the
resolution.

211. SPEECH AT ALL-INDIA COMMON SCRIPT AND
COMMON LANGUAGE CONFERENCE, LUCKNOW1
December 29, 1916
What I have got to say I shall say afterwards. I shall begin with
the lessons I have learnt from the speakers who have preceded me. I
hail from Gujarat. My Hindi is broken. I speak to you, brothers, in
that broken Hindi of mine, because even if I speak a little of English, I
have the feeling that I am committing a sin. I need not speak to you
about the glories of Hindi. Your desire to hear from me about the
glories of Hindi is as if someone who regularly bathes in the Ganga
should invoke that river to come to him. If someone living in
Rajputana were to make such a supplication, it would be different.
That you should study Hindi and master Devnagari is not for me to
tell you. It is as absurd as asking Muslims to learn Urdu. You say, I am
a man not of speech but of action. Then do what I say. Gentlemen,
you see that the Christian Literature Depot and Bible Society is going
all round the world. It scatters its books everywhere. It has them
translated into all the languages and then distributes them at the right
places. Even to the aborigines and working people in Africa it
provides the Bible in their own languages. It spends crores of rupees
on this job. They do not simply hold conferences like we do.

Sometimes they do meet but only to collect money or to submit their
reports. If we had men to teach Hindi, to do work, even the people of
Madras would be knowing Hindi today. It is not mere conferences but
work that we need—work such as the Christian Literature Depot and
Bible Society is doing. All work requires money. But there is no
paucity of money. There is paucity only of workers. If we have
workers, people in Gujarat, Madras, South India and elsewhere can
learn Hindi. Let more and more books be translated into Hindi, let
people go out and teach, and let those coming in be taught. If workers
are sent to the South or to Gujarat to teach and disseminate Hindi,
they will not be entirely unpaid, they will get subsistence wages. In
olden times, the age of the rishis, there was great self-sacrifice, and
learning was imparted without payment. I wanted to learn Hindi but
found no one in Ahmedabad to teach me. I learnt my Hindi from a
Gujarati gentleman who had only a working knowledge of the
language and who had spent 15 or 20 years in Benares. If the
conference sends out men, a large number of people will be able to
learn Hindi. You want swaraj. So do I. But the way to gain swaraj is a
different one altogether [from what is usually adopted]. Swaraj cannot
be got by mere talking. You must first do some work yourselves and
then only seek aid from the Government. Government aid will not be
forthcoming before that. If you first go forward on your own, the
Government will follow you. A Government never of itself takes the
first step. You go out and teach Hindi to people and put in earnest
work. Only when you have done some work will the Government
listen to you, otherwise it will throw your applications aside. The task
is a big one, but if you have the will you can construct the edifice of
swaraj. Panditji (Malaviyaji) has dwelt at length on our past glory.
English first had a vocabulary of a thousand words. Now it has
increased to a hundred thousand. There are books in that language on
all subjects, such as jurisprudence, medicine, etc. People say Hindi has
nothing and that we cannot do without English. At times people have
to put up with great inconvenience owing to ignorance of English. I
grant that it is so. On the trains people have to suffer much on account
of English. So much so, that people like me get pushed about for
speaking Hindi. But those who have work to do cannot take notice of
it. However backward Hindi may be as compared to English, we must
advance its status. Our ancient rishis lived under rigid rules of
conduct. They showed great self-sacrifice. We must gird up our loins
and do them honour by renouncing all self-interest. In Government
284

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

councils English alone counts. It is said that the Viceroy and others
know no language except English and that therefore it is necessary to
use only English. But I assert that if I know how to speak and if there
is something in my speech from which the Viceroy may benefit, he
will certainly hear it even if it is made in Hindi. If necessary he will get
it translated. Or a C.I.D. man will come and take a report of it. It is
from the people themselves that I ask for swaraj If you have received
this swaraj from the people, you will get it also from the Government.
Once you have done this, you will become truly fearless and your
aspirations will be fulfilled.

COMMON SCRIPT AND COMMON
LANGUAGE CONFERENCE, LUCKNOW
December 29, 1916
BROTHERS,

Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya has dwelt at length on the past
glory of Hindi. But this in itself will not make for the spread of the
National Language. You cannot get the merit of a dip in the
Bhagirathi1 by merely saying that the glory of the Bhagirathi is great.
Bhagirath prayatna2 is required if we want Hindi to spread. Which
language do you employ when you petition the Viceroy or the
Government? If you have not been employing Hindi, do so now. You
may say that you will not be heard if you use that language. I say to
you: Speak in your language, write in your language. If they have got
to hear what you say, they shall hear. I will say what I have to say in
my own language. He who has to listen will listen. If you act on this
resolve, the status of Hindi will rise. Hindi has not made much
headway in all provinces so far. The rashtra-bhasha3 is not yet
popular in the rashtra-sabha4 . Whose fault is it? I say it is yours. I

language. But there was none to be found in Ahmedabad who could
give lessons to me and to those in my Ashram. Hindi has not spread in
Madras yet. You have made no effort to that end. Please find five or
ten people who will go to Madras and spread Hindi. Pay them proper
remuneration. It is not difficult to find the funds for, after all, you
spend so much money on these conferences. If such an effort is made,
Hindi is bound to spread everywhere.

213. INTERVIEW AT LUCKNOW
[About December 29/31, 1916]
NATIONAL LANGUAGE
Q. Do you consider it necessary that the business of the Congress should be
conducted in Hindi, our national language?

A. I do. So long as public business is not conducted in Hindi,
the country cannot make progress. So long as the Congress does not
use Hindi for all its work, swaraj is not possible.
Q. But how can it be possible for people of all the provinces all of a sudden to
learn Hindi and start speaking it?

A. I do not say that the provinces should all give up their own
languages and start speaking, and writing Hindi. In provincial matters,
the provincial languages may be used. But national questions ought to
be deliberated in the national language only. It is not a very difficult
mater. It can be easily done. We should use Hindi for the work that we
are today doing in English.
S WARAJ OF C ONGRESS

Q. What do you think of the swaraj resolution passed by the
Congress and the way it is going to be implemented
A. It may be good or it may be bad, but I do not have any high
opinion of it.
Q. Why so?

A. Because ill-will is inherent in it.
Q. There wouldn’t seem to be any ill-will in it and if it has it is only towards

286

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

the bureaucracy.

A. It may be towards the bureaucracy, but it is ill-will all the
same. Therefore I have no high opinion of it. But I cannot say that the
venture is unworthy or that it will fail. Ill-will does not everywhere do
harm. Ill-will has to be shown towards ill-will when we wish
to remove it from our hearts. But this is not my way. This is
not the Indian way—the ancient, traditional way; this is the Western
way.
Q. Then what is your or rather our own Indian way?

A. We shall not go into it now.
INSTITUTION OF “VARNASHRAM”
Q. What are your views on the system of the four varnas?

A. It is a very good institution. It has done much good to the
country. It must be preserved.
Q. If there are only four varnas in Hindu society and if they are to remain as
they are, in which varna would you include the untouchable castes?

A. The untouchable castes owe their existence to the excesses of
the system. The four varnas ostracised them through undue excesses.
Their place is inside the system.
Q. If that is so, in which varna ought they to be placed?
Answering this question, Gandhiji explained at length how in the normal flow
of society they would all find the varnas to which they were entitled.

“SHUDDHI” MOVEMENT OF ARYA S AMAJ
Q. What will be the solution of the Hindu-Muslim question?

A. This question cannot be solved finally. What happened in
other countries will happen here. Hindus and Muslims will remain as
two communities and this will do no harm to the country.
Q. The Arya Samaj converts Muslims to Hinduism through shuddhi. If this
practice does not violate religion and if one can conceive that through it all the
Muslims can become Hindus, will it not solve the question?

A. But it is not the right path. It is not the path of religion. It is
not natural and the dream of converting all the Muslims to Hinduism
is a vain one.

LUCKNOW
December 31, 1916
The Muslim League resumed its sitting this morning, the attendance being as
large as yesterday. Mr. Wazir Hassan, Secretary of the League, presented the report of
the reform committee appointed at Bombay last year. The report was on the same
lines as the report that was placed before the National Congress this year.
A resolution protesting against the treatment of Indians in the Colonies was
next put from the chair (Mr. Jinnah) and carried.
At this stage, Mr. Gandhi who was present at the meeting was asked to address
the meeting.
He exhorted them to conduct their proceedings in Urdu if they wished to carry
out their resolution to maintain Urdu as the lingua franca of India. He further urged
them to take some interest in Hindu literature which would enable them to arrive at a
permanent rapprochement with the Hindus. In the Colonies, Hindus and Mussalmans
had always co-operated in taking concerted measures and, if that example was
followed in India, the coveted prize would soon be theirs. He also advised them that in
the course of their propaganda they should not be afraid of the Government because it
was in the nature of Englishmen to bow before the strong and ride over the weak.

It was at Agra that this letter came accidentally to-my hands. It
was printed in the Government press and was marked ‘private’. But it
came to my hands through the mistake of some pressman along with a
book. The moment I saw it I was startled, and on seeing the danger
that stood before the country, I resolved to expose the conspiracy
before the Congress somehow or other, and I handed it over to Mr.
Horniman1 . But at that time l made a suggestion that Mr. Curtis should
be given 24 hours’ notice to make any explanation which he thought
fit. But others thought it was one’s duty to publish it then and there,
and that there was no necessity to give such a notice; I also agreed to
this. If underneath our houses somebody digs a mine and fills it with
explosives, and if our enemy thinks of blowing it up when there is a
gathering there, and he sends a chit round marked ‘Private and
confidential’, it is our duty to catch hold of it and expose it. I know
Mr. Curtis for a long time. His brother was in South Africa. I think
that because of the publication of this letter, the game of putting India

January 14, 1917
MY DEAR FRIEND,

Your post has become irregular nowadays. I have missed two
weeks. I was at Lucknow and so besieged by visitors and filled with
appointments that I had no time left. I hope you will forgive me.
The Ashram has never been so free from illness as it is at
present. Everybody is enjoying good health except myself. I suffered
from malnutrition in Lucknow and have not thrown off the effect yet.
But I too am steadily gaining ground. I tried there to live on monkeynuts and dates only. It brought on constipation.
Chhaganlal has accepted service in a mill in Baroda. He is
leaving us tomorrow. Manilal and Ramdas will leave for Phoenix next
month. Mrs. Gandhi has gone to Porbunder to stay with her brother
for a few weeks. Imam Saheb returns to us in a week’s time. This

DEAR ESTHER,

I was pleased to receive your nice letter and hear that Miss
Peterson had thrown off her cold entirely.
I am glad you found peace in the Ashram. Yes, both of you we
regard as members of the family. You will come whenever you wish to
and can.
Ramdas 1 is a noble boy. He is the one going to South Africa.2 I
feel sure that he will give a good account of himself there. By way of
preparation he has been attending a printing press here, practising at
the compositor’s desk.
I have learnt enough of you to know that you will put your
whole heart into your studies and soon be talking enough Tamil for
your purpose.
Pray keep the rules3 as long as you like. There is no occasion to
hurry over sending them. With kind regards,
Yours,

You will see from the enclosed what fate befell my poor post

I have resolved on two changes: one, that in buying land for the
farm our object should be to have a good return by way of yield, the
object being that even a man with a family may be drawn to this work;
two, to start a national school 2 , be it on a big scale or small, and
engage well-educated teachers for it. Paid men should be engaged for
both these purposes and the payment should be at market rates. You
can also be taken as a paid man. The idea is to entrust you mainly
with the accounts of these departments. This is not final, though. What
is certain is that you should be engaged on payment. You will be able
to live in the Ashram if you wish to. If you want to live apart, you can
do that also. You can be paid a salary which you consider necessary to
meet the expenses in Ahmedabad. If you want to join this work, think
over the matter and let me know. There is no particular need for

226. NATIONAL GUJARATI SCHOOL
[After January 18, 1917] 1
P ROSPECTUS

For many years past, several friends and I have felt that our
present education is not national and that in consequence people do
not get from it the benefit they ought to. Our children languish as a
result of this education. They become incapable of any great
achievement and the knowledge they acquire does not spread among
the masses—not even in their families. Nor do the young people have
any aim in mind in taking this modern education except to get a job
and make money. It is one of the fundamental principles of education
that it should be planned with a view to the needs of the people. This
idea finds no place at all in our schools.
Wherever I have travelled in India, I have discussed this question
with the leaders and, without exception, almost every one has admitted
that our educational system must change.
To look to the Government for this will be sheer waste of time.
The Government will wait on public opinion and, being foreign, move
very timidly; it cannot understand our needs, its advisers may be
ill-informed or they may have interests of their own to serve. For a
variety of such reasons, it will probably be quite long before there is
any serious change in the present system; the time that passes
meanwhile is so much loss to the people.
It is, however, not intended to suggest here that we should not
try to get the Government to move. Let petitions be made to it and let
public opinion be ascertained. But the best petition to the Government
will be an actual demonstration by us and this will also be the easiest
way of cultivating public opinion. It has accordingly been decided, in
consultation with some educated gentlemen, to start a national school.
Education in the School
Basic principle: The education will be physical, intellectual and
religious.
For physical education, there will be training in agriculture and
hand-weaving and in the use of carpenter’s and blacksmith’s tools
incidental to these. That will provide sufficient exercise for the pupils.
1

296

Vide the preceding item.
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

In addition, they will be given drill, which is both an entertainment
[and a practical utility]1 and, as part of this, they will be taught how to
march in squads and how each one may work with quiet efficiency in
case of accidents such as fire.
They will have instruction on how to preserve health and on
home remedies for ordinary ailments, with as much of physiology and
botany as may be necessary for the purpose.
For intellectual training, they will study Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi
and Sanskrit as compulsory subjects. Urdu, Tamil and Bengali will
also be taught.
There will be no teaching of English during the first three years.
In addition, the pupils will be taught Mathematics (Arithmetic,
Algebra and Geometry). Instruction in multiplication tables, Indian
book-keeping and the measures, weights, etc., currently in use will
begin at once and the rest of the curriculum will be covered
progressively.
There will be instruction in History, Geography, Elements of
Astronomy and Elements of Chemistry.
By way of instruction in religion, pupils will be taught general
ethical principles and we are hopeful that the teachers will demonstrate
by their conduct that the essence of religion is good character.
All teaching will be through Gujarati, right up to the highest
stage, and most of it will be oral during the first few years. The
intention is to put across to the children, before they learn to read and
write, quite a few things orally by way of stories, as was the practice in
old days, and so help their minds to grow, and to give them some
general knowledge as they play about, rather than repress them by
doing nothing more than remarking, “Oh dear, dear! How dirty”, and
so on.
EXPLANATION

The aim at present is that after a few years of such education, the
student’s equipment will approximate to that of a well-informed
graduate. That is, he will have a reduced load by way of learning
English and, during the time so saved, he will be given all the useful
knowledge a graduate acquires. He will be freed from the fear of
examinations. All the students will be tested from time to time, but that
1

The original is very faint here.

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

297

will be by the teachers of the school itself. The use to which the
student puts his abilities after leaving school will be the true measure
of the worth of his education. Every opportunity will be taken to rid
his mind of the fallacious notion that the aim of education is to get
employment. And, finally, every pupil joining this school is likely to
develop such self-confidence in a few years that he will not be
troubled with doubts or fears about how he will make a living. A pupil
who has been in the school for five years will be fixed up, if he so
desires, in some work in the school itself and be paid for it. The
school will make arrangements with some factories, etc., so that they
provide training in vocations and give a start to those who wish to set
themselves up independently. If, after ten years of study, anyone wants
to pursue a subject further, necessary arrangements for the purpose
are left to the future.
F REE EDUCATION

No fees will be charged in this school, the expenses being met
from donations received.
TEACHERS

Paid teachers will be engaged and will be, all of them, grown-up
men who have reached the college level or possess equivalent
attainments. The idea is that children should have the best teachers in
the early stages.

DEAR DR. DEVA 3 ,

I have your p.c. I feel that every time we met to celebrate the
anniversary, we should take a step in advance in keeping with the
ideals for which Mr. Gokhale stood. Such is the suggestion I have
made locally and it has been accepted. This year, therefore, here we
shall probably publish a Gujarati translation of all Mr. Gokhale’s
speeches. I make a similar suggestion for Poona. There we may
resolve at the meeting to translate his speeches in Marathi if they are
not already translated or do some other practical thing. I would so like
that he may live more and more in us and through us and thereby
through the whole nation. This will not happen unless at such
functions we take progressive steps. I am pulled in opposite directions
by two attractions—one from Poona and the other from Ahmedabad.
There are reasons for which I should like to be in Ahmedabad that
day. There are equally good reasons which tell me I should go to
Poona. You shall decide as to what I should do. Friends here have left

229. INTRODUCTION TO “VERNACULARS
AS MEDIA OF INSTRUCTION”
[February 1, 1917] 2
The following is the introduction written by Mr. M. K. Gandhi to Dr. P. J.
Mehta’s ‘Self-Government Series’ Pamphlet No. I entitled Vernaculars as Media of
Instruction in Indian Schools and Colleges:

It is to be hoped that Dr. Mehta’s labour of love will receive the
serious attention of English-educated India. The following pages were
written by him for the Vedanta Kesari of Madras and are now printed
in their present form for circulation throughout India. The question
of vernaculars as media of instruction is of national importance;
neglect of the vernaculars means national suicide. One hears many
protagonists of the English language being continued as the medium
of instruction pointing to the fact that English-educated Indians are
the sole custodians of public and patriotic work. It would be
monstrous if it were not so. For, the only education given in this
country is through the English language. The fact, however, is that the
results are not at all proportionate to the time we give to our
education. We have not reacted on the masses. But I must not
anticipate Dr. Mehta. He is in earnest. He writes feelingly. He has
examined the pros and cons and collected a mass of evidence in
support of his arguments. The latest pronouncement on the subject is
that of the Viceroy. Whilst His Excellency is unable to offer a solution,
he is keenly alive to the necessity of imparting instruction in our

schools through the vernaculars. The Jews of Middle and Eastern
Europe, who are scattered in all parts of the world, finding it necessary
to have a common tongue for mutual intercourse, have raised Yiddish
to the status of a language and have succeeded in translating into
Yiddish the best books to be found in the world’s literature. Even they
could not satisfy the soul’s yearning through the many foreign
tongues of which they are masters; nor did the learned few among
them wish to tax the masses of the Jewish population with having to
learn a foreign language before they could realise their dignity. So
they have enriched what was at one time looked upon as a mere
jargon—but what the Jewish children learnt from their mothers—by
taking special pains to translate into it the best thought of the world.
This is a truly marvellous work. It has been done during the present
generation, and Webster’s Dictionary defines it as a polyglot jargon
used for inter-communication by Jews from different nations.
But a Jew of Middle and Eastern Europe would feel insulted if
his mother tongue were now so described. If these Jewish scholars
have succeeded, within a generation, in giving their masses a language,
of which they may feel proud, surely it should be an easy task for us
to supply the needs of our own vernaculars which are cultured
languages. South Africa teaches us the same lesson. There was a duel
there between Taal, a corrupt form of Dutch, and English. The Boer
mothers and the Boer fathers were determined that they would not let
their children, with whom they in their infancy talked in Taal, be
weighed down with having to receive instruction through English. The
case of English here was a strong one. It had able pleaders for it. But
English had to yield before Boer patriotism. It may be observed that
they rejected even the High Dutch. The school masters, therefore, who
are accustomed to speak the polished Dutch of Europe, are compelled
to teach the easier Taal. And literature of an excellent character is at
the present moment growing up in South Africa in the Taal, which was
only a few years ago the common medium of speech between simple
but brave rustics. If we have lost faith in our vernaculars, it is a sign of
want of faith in ourselves; it is the surest sign of decay. And no
scheme of Self-Government, however benevolently or generously it
may be bestowed upon us, will ever make us a self-governing nation,
if we have no respect for the languages our mothers speak.

230. A FOREWORD1
S ATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,
AHMEDABAD ,

Maha Sud 10, Samvat 1973, [February 1, 1917]
I wish Bhai Karsandas2 success in his endeavour. Eating or
drinking, awake or asleep, sitting or standing, Bhai Karsandas Chitalia
always has the Bhagini Samaj uppermost in his mind. He believes that
the service of women is the service of the country and that the service
of women is possible through the Bhagini Samaj. That is why Bhai
Karsandas has become the moving spirit of the Bhagini Samaj. In
doing so, he is fully keeping the pledge he has taken for the Servants
of India Society. This is his belief. Once Bhai Deodhar remarked in
jest that some way would have to be found to cure Bhai Karsandas of
the obsession. This remark was by way of a homage and the homage
was genuine. India badly needs persons who can be so totally
dedicated to their work. I know Karsandas to be such a person, so I
could not decline his request to write the foreword.
Since I had to write the foreword, I was forced to read the book
by Bhogindrarao Divetia. Many problems concerning women have
been discussed in this work in a beautiful, easy and concise language.
Instead of asserting his views, Devatia has merely expressed them by
way of suggestions. It has struck me as a distinctive trait of Divetia’s
writing. In a book about women, for that matter even about men,
meant for the general reader, assertions become a hindrance. I hope
that the reader will not infer that because I am writing this
introduction I approve of all the reforms the author advocates. Bhai
Divetia has placed his views before the reader in an interesting
manner. Hence. it may be hoped that his writing will be widely read.
In his dialogues the writer has depicted the husband as a teacher
to his wife. This seems pretty realistic. We desire girls’ education. But
we have yet to discover what type of education it should be. For the
present, we are only experimenting. But we are not going to bring
about women’s education merely through girls’ schools. Thousands

of girls disappear from before our eyes by becoming victims to child
marriage as early as at the age of twelve. They become housewives! So
long as this sinful custom does not disappear from amongst us, men
will have to learn to be the teachers of women. [The fulfilment of]
many of our hopes lies in their education in this respect. So long as
our women do not cease to be objects of our lust and our cooks and
do not become our better halves, sharing our happiness and misery, all
our efforts will be futile. Some people regard their wives as animals.
Some of the things in our old Sanskrit texts, as also a famous couplet
of Tulsidas, are to blame for this. Tulsidas has written in one place:
“drums, boors, shudras, animals and women, all are fit to be beaten.”
I am a devotee of Tulsidas. But my devotion is not blind. Either the
above couplet is an interpolation, or if it is really by Tulsidas, he must
have written it without thought, only expressing the prevalent attitude.
As for the utterances in the Sanskrit texts, the idea seems to have
become fixed that every verse coined in Sanskrit is the word of the
scriptures. We must get rid of this false notion and do away with this
age-old attitude that regards women as inferior creatures. On the other
hand, some of us, blinded by passion, worship women as a goddess or
treat her as a doll and decorate her with ornaments as we decorate the
idols every day. It is necessary for us to free ourselves of this wrong
worship also. Shiva had Uma, Rama had Sita, Nala had Damayanti.
When our women, too, participate in our discussions, argue with us,
understand and support our utterances, with their extraordinary
intuition, understand and share our external troubles and bring to us
the balm of peace, then, and not till then, will our salvation become
possible. There is very little chance of bringing about such a situation
merely through girls’ schools. So long as we carry round our necks
the millstone of child-marriage, husbands will have to act as teachers
to their wives. And such education must not be confined to a
knowledge of letters. Gradually they can be introduced to subjects
like polities and social reform. Literacy should not be a precondition
to this. Husbands will have to change their attitude towards their wives.
Is it not possible for a woman to remain a student till she attains
maturity and for the husband to observe brahmacharya till such time?
Unless we were crushed with insensibility and inertia, we would
certainly not subject a girl of twelve or fifteen to the great strain of
child-bearing. The very thought should make us shudder.
There are classes for married women and lectures are arranged
for them. All this is fine. Those who are engaged in such activities are
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

303

sacrificing their time and that too is a matter of credit to them. At the
same time so long as men do not do their duty as stated above, we are
not likely to get very good results. With a little thought, everyone will
find this self-evident. Hence, it may be expected that if the Bhagini
Samaj can spread among husbands the desire to educate their wives, its
objectives can be attained faster.

231. SPEECH AT ANTI-INDENTURE MEETING, AHMEDABAD1
February 4, 1917
Today we, men, have assembled here to register our protest
against this system and tomorrow there is to be a meeting of women in
the Mahadev2 temple of Sathodara Nagars3 . These women’s meetings
started with the one at Kanpur. As Mr. Polak and Mr. Andrews report,
women labourers suffer very much in the Colonies and hence women
too should join in the protest. I have seen in Natal the conditions of
indentured women and know what they suffer. Girmit [agreement] is
an English term and means binding oneself under a contract to work
as a labourer. But the Indian labourers in the Colonies understand by
the term girmitio a slave, because they feel their condition to be no
better than that of slaves. When the British people had succeeded in
putting an end to legalized traffic in slaves, they required another race
to work as slaves for them. They have been recruiting these from
among Negroes and our people. As Mr. Curtis says 4 , we are only a
little better than Negroes. The law permitting recruitment of
indentured labour came into being 50 years ago. It had the result of
placing Indians in the same condition as slaves. The late Sir William
Hunter himself described it as slavery. It was in 1896 that a protest was
first made against this enslaving law. It had no effect then and things
remained as they were up to 1911. In that year, the practice was
prohibited only in respect of Natal. In Fiji, however, the condition of

Indian labourers has been worse than it was in Natal. There was a
strong public opinion in Natal, but there is none in Fiji. Lord
Hardinge declared last year1 that the law would be repealed very soon.
We had hoped then that it would go after a year or 50. But we hear
now, one and a half years after the declaration, that the law will remain
for five more years and that afterwards they would see what could be
done. This report has revived our concern for the sufferings of our
fellow-countrymen and it has become our duty now to raise a strong
protest to ensure the immediate repeal of the law. The agitation was
launched at Allahabad and, meetings having already been held at
Madras, Poona and other places, we also have met here to register our
protest. Mr. Andrews has dedicated his life to this struggle.
Mr. Gokhale had the fullest confidence in him and, at his instance,
Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pearson went to Fiji to see things for themselves.
He [Mr. Andrews] had £300 with him—this was all he had —and this
he made over to the Satyagraha Fund at Lahore. He no longer wants
to be styled Reverend, but thinks it an honour to be known as
Tagore’s disciple. Mr. Polak is known to you. He is young, and if the
young people here were to do even a tenth of what he has done, we
should have swaraj this moment.

232. STATEMENT ON ABOLITION OF INDENTURED LABOUR
[After February 7, 1917]
There is no doubt that we are engaged in a severe struggle for
the preservation of our honour and that, if we do not take care, the
promise made by Lord Hardinge that indentured labour should soon
be a thing of the past may be reduced to a nullity. The Viceregal
pronouncement just made2 seems to set at rest one fear that the system
may be prolonged for a further period of five years which, as Sir
Ramakrishna Bhandarkar showed at Poona, would in reality mean ten
years. We are thankful to Lord Chelmsford for his assurance. And we
are thankful, too, to that good Englishman Mr. C.F. Andrews, for the
lead that he gave us in the matter. So soon as he gained the

information from Fiji that five years’ extension was taken by the
planters of those lands as a settled fact, he forsook his sick-bed and his
rest at Shantiniketan and sounded for us the call of duty.
But if one cloud that threatened to destroy our hopes seems to
have disappeared, another equally dangerous looms on the horizon.
The conditions of abolition as stated by Lord Hardinge last March 1
are these:
On behalf of His Majesty’s Government, he the Secretary of State
has asked us, however, to make it clear that the existing system of recruiting
must be maintained until new conditions under which labour should not be
permitted to proceed to the Colonies should have been worked out in
conjunction with the Colonial Office and the Crown Colonies concerned; until
proper safeguards in the Colonies should have been provided and until they
should have had reasonable time to adjust themselves to the change, a period
which must necessarily depend on circumstances and conditions imperfectly
known at present.

Those of us who know anything of the system knew that it was
well-nigh impossible to find new conditions which would be
economically sound for the planters and morally sound for us. We felt
that the Government would soon find this out for themselves and that,
in view of Lord Hardinge’s whole-hearted disapproval of the system,
his view of the nearness of the end would coincide with our2 own. But
now a different situation faces us. Nearly a year has gone by and we
discover that the planters of Fiji have been led to believe that they will
have five years more of the system and at the end of it new conditions
may after all be a change in name but not in substance. Let Mr. Bonar
Law’s3 despatch speak for itself. Writing under date March 4, 1916, to
the Acting Governor of Fiji, he says:
The Secretary of State for India is satisfied that it would not be
possible for the Government of India to continue to defeat by a bare official
majority resolutions in their Legislative Council, urging the abolition of
indenture; that in his opinion the strong and universal feeling in India on this

subject makes it a question of urgency and that he has accepted the conclusion
that indentured emigration must be abolished.

He then proceeds:
Though, from the point of view of the Colonies concerned, the
decision which the Indian Government and the Secretary of State for India have
taken is to be regretted, I recognize that the final decision upon this question
must rest with the Indian Government.

Thus, the humanities of the question are tacitly supposed to be
no concern of the Colonies.
Now mark this significant paragraph culled from the same
illuminating despatch:
I have, therefore, agreed to the appointment of an
inter-departmental committee to consider what system should be substituted
for the system of indenture, should be allowed for a further period of five years
and should cease at the end of that period. . . .The Secretary of State for India is
anxious that the change of system should be brought about with as little
disturbance as possible to the economic interests of the Colonies and that he
has made it clear that the existing system must be maintained until a properly
safeguarded system has been devised.

Mr. Andrews has been twitted for having referred to the five
years’ extension. Let his critics explain away Mr. Bonar Law’s
emphatic pronouncement published in the Fiji newspapers. What with
the official statement and the Secretary of State for India’s solicitude
for the economic interests of the planters, our cause may easily be lost
if we are found unwatchful.
In the light of the Viceregal speech and Mr. Bonar Law’s
despatch, our duty seems to be clear. We must strengthen the
Government’s hands where necessary and even stimulate their activity
so that this inter-departmental committee is not allowed to frustrate
our hopes. It is a body wherein the influence of the Crown Colonies
and the Colonial Office will be preponderant. It is a body which has to
find a substitute which would be acceptable to us. As I hold, it will be
a vain search if the mere well-being of the labourer is to be the
primary consideration. But if the planters can have their own way, we
know that they will urge an impossible substitute and, in the event of
its rejection by us, they will, in accordance with Mr. Bonar Law’s
despatch, claim continuance of recruiting under indenture. It must
therefore be clearly understood that the onus of producing an
acceptable substitute rests with them and not with us. They have had
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

307

more than a year already. Lord Hardinge’s despatch urging total
abolition is dated the 15th October 1915. The committee is to sit in
May next. This period for finding a substitute is long enough in all
conscience. Either Mr. Andrews’ harrowing picture of the conditions
of life in Fiji is true or it is untrue. We believe it to be true and it has
never been seriously attacked. And in waiting for over a year, we shall
have waited almost beyond the point of endurance. Substitute or no
substitute, we are entitled for the sake of our own honour and
reputation and indeed that of the Empire to the unconditional
abolition of this last remnant of slavery. Natal stopped 1 the system
without the provision of a substitute. Mauritius has done likewise. The
Johannesburg mines survived not only the shock of an abrupt
termination of Chinese labour but the withdrawal of every Chinese
labourer from the country as fast as transport could be got ready.
Capital is both bold and timid. If only we shall do our duty, if
only the Government of India will steel their hearts against the
blandishments of the Fijian and West Indian planters, there is no doubt
that these people will know how to save millions without India’s
having to go to their rescue.

233. SPEECH AT ANTI-INDENTURE MEETING,
BOMBAY
February 9, 1917
At a public meeting held at the Excelsior Theatre, Bombay, on February 9,
1917, under the presidentship of Sir Jamsetji Jeejibhoy, a resolution, moved by Sir
N.G. Chandavarkar, demanding the immediate abolition of indentured labour, was
unanimously passed. Mr. H. A. Wadia then proposed that the chairman of the meeting
be authorised to communicate the resolution to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for
India and H. E. the Viceroy and Governor-General of India by telegram.
Mr. M. K. Gandhi supporting the resolution said that, yielding to the
command of his friends on the platform, he had undertaken to speak to them in
English on that occasion. The resolution which he supported asked that the preceding
resolution be sent to the Secretary of State for India and H. E. the Viceroy by
telegram. What was the meaning of this? They had fixed with great deliberation the

31st of May of this year as the last date on which this remnant of slavery should come
to an end. (Applause.) It meant that they had slept for nearly 50 years and allowed this
system to continue, but that immediately they were awakened to their sense of
responsibility and duty, they did not like to sleep for a day longer and it was,
therefore, that they wished that the resolution should be wired without a moment’s
delay. In passing that resolution, they were strengthening the hands of the
Government and were awakening the Colonies to a sense of their duty to consider
India as an integral part of the Empire. It would also strengthen the Viceroy’s hands,
and H. E. the Viceroy could say that he would no longer govern India if they were not
ready to remove the blot of indentured labour before the 31st of May. (Applause.) The
honour of the people of India was at stake and they were bound to think of it, waking
or sleeping. He asked them to remember the 31st of May. Till then let them not sleep.
(Applause).

Announcing that the proceedings of the meeting would be in an Indian
language, Gandhiji, who was in the chair, said:

The system of indenture under which helpless, illiterate sisters
and brothers from our country are reduced to utter misery must end
forthwith. We shall fix May 31 as the date by which it should be
stopped. Clapping our hands will not avail us much. We shall succeed
in our aim only if we approach the intending recruits themselves in
their homes and dissuade them from joining up; and this task is yours.

ANNIVERSARY
DELHI ,

February 17, 1917
SIR,

Upon the advice of the Hon. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya
and other friends, I venture to draw public attention to a suggestion I
have made to my Ahmedabad friends regarding the celebration of the
Gokhale anniversary on the 19th instant. It is to the effect that we
should at these meetings take a definite practical step from year to
year to promote some public object in keeping with the teachings of
the deceased patriot. Ahmedabad will probably raise subscriptions for
translating and publishing in Gujarati Mr. Gokhale’s speeches to be
ready for circulation at the latest on the next anniversary. Other
centres may translate other works or may raise subscriptions to found
scholarships for some special training. If some such definite and not
very ambitious steps are taken at the hundreds of meetings that will be
held yearly, the educational advance we shall have in a few years will,
it is held, be not inconsiderable.

You are right in what you say about education. It is good that
you should go on harassing me on the subject. That will keep me
more vigilant. I shall not misunderstand your worrying me or be
impatient with it.
Tell Dr. Hariprasad that it looks as if I can bring along the
article for Gokhale’s death anniversary only when I go there. He
should make the necessary arrangements to get it printed on Monday.
Whatever collection is possible, he should make at the meeting itself.
You are right in saying that, since the school curriculum
provides for Marathi,3 we too should start learning it. You may discuss
with me this and other points concerning education on the day I
return from Godhra. Make a note of such points. It is for you to get
Popatlal and Fulchand to do any work connected with teaching.
I hope you have completed the accounts and made Fulchand

238. SPEECH ON GOKHALE ANNIVERSARY
AT GODHRA
February 19, 1917
Gandhiji presided at a crowded meeting held at Godhra on February 19, 1917 in
connection with the Gokhale anniversary, when a resolution was moved appointing a
committee to take steps to keep green the memory of Gokhale by furthering the cause
of education in the district which was so dear to his heart.

After the resolution was supported and adopted, Mr. Gandhi rose to deliver his
presidential address. The first point he touched was the religious catholicity of Mr.
Gokhale, who, on one occasion, rebuked a seeming sadhu who drew a sharp line of
difference between Hindus and Mahomedans. Religious convictions were fast
dwindling in this country everywhere, but then another religion was developing and
that was love of country. Mr. Gokhale cultivated this religion to the highest level to
the point where he laid down his life in the service of the Motherland.
Mr. Gandhi dwelt in his own inimitable and impressive manner on two great
qualities of Mr. Gokhale which should always go with patriotism: love of truth and
fearlessness. Whilst most people expressed opinions which would be palatable to the
hearers, Mr. Gokhale always gave to the officials and the public the result of his
mature studies and deliberation.
Mr. Gandhi advised all officials, high or low, to take a leaf from the career of
Mr. Gokhale who, though highly placed in life as a member of the Imperial
Legislative Council, was always kind and gentle towards all his fellow-countrymen.
Mr. Gandhi remarked that the feeling of patriotism which pervaded thousands of men,
young and old, was running to waste like the river Ganges, which flowed from the
Himalayas into the Bay of Bengal, for want of the sterling qualities of truthfulness
and fearlessness.
Finally, Mr. Gandhi urged the people of the city to support energetically the
Committee which had been appointed to further the cause of education in the
district and thanked all who had given him such a magnificent and hearty welcome to
the city.

February 23, 1917
Seeing sister Sarojini today, I was reminded of Lord Colin
Campbell who came out to India as Commander-in-Chief at the time
of the Mutiny in 1857. In those days, military officers used camels
very freely for transporting luxury articles and they were not available
in sufficient number for carrying provisions, etc. Lord Colin
Campbell, therefore, kept only one camel for himself and thus tacitly

reminded the other officers of their duty. This had the effect of
reducing in some measure the discontent among the troops. Though
Sarojini travels first class, the luggage she carries is contained in just
two boxes. I have observed her life at home and come to respect her
for that. She has had four children, the youngest being now 13. At
present, therefore, she lives very nearly like one in the vanaprastha1
stage of life. Though a millionaire’s daughter and a millionaire’s wife,
she runs her house with great skill. She yearns for one thing only,
lndia’s advance. If she has lashed out at us, it is to urge us to strive for
perfection. Hindus and Muslims are the same to her. English has
almost become her mother tongue. But she believes we shall make no
progress unless Indian languages come into their own. Let us purge
ourselves of all our weaknesses and make her lofty ideals our own.

240. SPEECH AT SURAT ON INDENTURE2
February 26, 1917
SISTERS AND BROTHERS,

It is obvious that I, a resident of Ahmedabad, can have no
knowledge of civic affairs in Surat. When I arrived here, it was
suggested to me that I should take the chair. I was rather surprised. I
felt that I was not the proper person to do so. As I knew little about
the civic affairs here, I respected the suggestion of local friends and
told them that they could put forward my name if my taking the chair
would help matters. I am quite conscious of my responsibility. I
cannot claim, moreover, that I have come here prepared for the
matters to be debated and the resolutions to be passed. This is why I
feel I am not the proper person. I shall request you all, sisters and
brothers, to overlook any deficiency that you may observe in me.
Before I start the proceedings, I shall deliver Mrs. Sarojini Naidu’s
message. When she was in Ahmedabad, I told her it would be good if
she could go to Surat. But she said she had an important engagement
on Sunday. Later, there was a telegram from Dr. Hora and I told her

again that Surat should not feel disappointed and asked her to come
along. I also found out from her the nature of her engagement to see
if I could urge her to come. The lady has been in bad health for
several years past. She has such strength of mind, however, and such is
her love for the motherland, that, when occasion demands, she makes
it possible to meet it. God alone knows from where she gets the
strength, but she who looked worn out just a moment earlier betrays
no signs of suffering on her face when she is at work. So wonderful is
her strength. There is to be a big meeting in Bombay on the 27th and
she must conserve her health to be able to make a complete success of
it. As her coming to Surat would have made this impossible, she did
not know how to manage it. Even so, we should make every sacrifice
and agitate on this issue; if for no other reason, out of consideration
for this lady who, an ornament to India, goes up and down all over the
country taking no thought of her health. There is no religion among
us which does not forbid our undertaking a second task before we
have completed the first. You have come forward at this meeting to
take upon yourself a great responsibility. But one has no right to
assume an additional burden before one has fully discharged a duty
already undertaken. What I have in mind is this: I was here last year
and you promised to collect a fund for the saint-like Gokhale. I have
heard nothing further about it. Mr. Adwani put down Rs. 50/- and the
matter never went beyond that. I met him in Godhra but did not have
the courage to mention the subject to him. It is not yet too late for
you to raise something for the fund, though, of course, collections for
the Fund in the charge of Mr. Jehangir Petit are over. I think even the
Trust Deed in respect of that Fund is ready. It is still open to you,
however, to send contributions to the Servants of India Society. And
so everyone should pay, each according to his means. Perhaps Surat,
the object of Narmadashanker’s1 praises, thought that it would either
pay in thousands or nothing. But I would say that, if you subscribe Rs.
100/- this time, you will be able to pay Rs. 1,000/- next time. The
matter is important for this reason: Mrs. Naidu has been sacrificing
herself for the cause. Besides, Mahatma Gokhale was drawn into it in
1896 and in 1912 he made the cause his own. I know also that his
speeches at the time affected his health. You should, therefore remind
yourselves of your promise to raise a fund in memory of this man
who had even sacrificed his life for this cause, and give to it to the best
1

314

A Gujarati poet also called Narmad
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

of your means. The gentleman who proposed me [to the chair] said
that, of the two questions, that concerning volunteers [for the Army]
was the more important one. I shall say, though, that the question of
in- denture is more important. It is of course right that we express
satisfaction over the right of offering ourselves as volunteers, but the
satisfaction will avail us nothing unless we follow up the expression of
it with necessary action. In regard to the issue of indenture, on the
other hand, it is our unceasing duty to see that no town or village,
known or unknown, goes without a protest against this system. You
know that I have come from Delhi. I have had meetings with His
Excellency the Viceroy and other leaders of the nation. Like Mrs.
Sarojini Naidu and the late Mr. Gokhale, Mr. Andrews too has made
sacrifices. As he pondered over this problem, he was so upset in mind
that he took ill. Even his speech, which has been translated into every
language, had to be read out by Mr. Polak. We should now hold
public meetings for the purpose. We do not at all embarrass the
Government by doing so; on the contrary, we strengthen its hands.
The Government itself has admitted that the system is immoral and
brings no benefit whatever. Possibly there is some economic gain but,
in view of the moral degradation it has brought about, it must be
ended. This is an issue on which there is no difference of opinion.
The Editor of The Times of India asks who should solve this problem
and when. Pat will come the reply: that is exclusively India’s right. On
this matter, we can imagine things far more vividly than the Viceroy. I
shall give only one illustration of this. The worthy Baji Gauri is ill and
her younger sister has been attending on her and has suffered in
health in consequence. I, as a resident of Ahmedabad, will not feel this
as much as people here, and none will feel as much as the younger
sister. If it were otherwise, I would be by her bed-side all the time. In
the same way, the Viceroy cannot imagine as well as we can the
condition of our own brothers and sisters. We should lay down a
time-limit and say that we would tolerate the system up to May 31 and
that, if it continued even a day longer, thousands will lay down their
lives. The system has been in existence for fifty years. It is a matter of
shame for us that, in all these years, it is only recently that we have
taken up discussion of a resolution like this. I do not, however, wish to
go into that matter. I have had 20 years, experience of this problem
and it is but natural, therefore, that my heart should cry out before
you and my imagination grow active; I hope you will forgive me if I
set out these things before you at such length. The system is but a
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

315

form 1 of slavery. We have in it, under the British Empire, elements of
the very system which England claims proudly to have abolished; this
system can be described as slavery for a limited period. All the
essential elements of the earlier system are present in this, and one
more. It makes one shudder to know all. The system brings India’s
womanhood to utter ruin, destroys all sense of modesty. That in
defence of which millions in this country have laid down their lives in
the past is lost under it.
I am not here to excite your feelings. Mr. Andrews can be far
more effective in that way than I. He has given quite a vivid picture. I
wish that, when you read the literature on this subject which I have
here, you feel as excited as I do. I pray for Smt. Baji Gauri again; may
God help her to a speedy recovery. However, her suffering is nothing
as compared to that of our sisters beyond the seas. If, to our
misfortune, Baji Gauri’s atman should leave her body, it would have
ascended to a higher existence. But which astronomer here, in this
hall, can predict the future of the thousands of her sisters who suffer
moral degradation? Every one of us has it in him to treat this disease.
We should be ready to sacrifice our all to that end. We should
respectfully tell the Viceroy that the practice must be abolished before
May 31. Let us take a pledge today that we will not suffer the thing
beyond that date. I shall close this chapter here.
I confess myself ignorant in the matter of the right of joining as
volunteers. When I first took up the issue, I wondered why India had
been denied this right. Perhaps we did not deserve it. The right is now
ours. Today, the educated class in India understands my ideas. I am
entirely opposed to fighting with arms. I have no faith in the thing.
Possession of arms for our or others’ defence will serve no useful
purpose; nor have we the requisite strength. I believe that, in place of
the strength of a Kshatriya pitted against an armed opponent,
soul-force will prove far more potent. There was a great British
warrior, General Gordon by name. The man who drew his portrait has
won high praise [for his work]. He put into Gordon’s hand neither a
sword nor a gun, but only a stick: I would even say that, had the
painter drawn him with folded hands and put light in his eyes, on the
lips and the entire face, to suggest that the whole world could not
shake him from his purpose, that would have been the true Kshatriya
character. Such are my views, but all do not find them acceptable.

Some of them have little use for these views and others perhaps do not
have the strength to follow them in practice. In this matter, your duty
is [not to run away from an enemy]1 ; it will be a grave lapse if you do,
saying in excuse ahimsa paramo dharmah 2 . You wish destruction of
your enemy some way or other. Because you cherish belief in
non-violence, it does not mean that you are effectively observing the
rule, for in that rule there is no place for running away in fear. It is
your duty to defend those among the Indian people who want
themselves, their women, their moral standards and their wealth to be
defended. How to do this? Those who have no faith in the principle
which is dear to me and which I embrace may certainly take up arms.
It is for this reason that I welcome the right of enlisting as volunteers
which has been granted to us. I shall advise the people in this hall to
join up. If anyone asks me whether he would be offered a commission
or not, I would tell him to reserve such grumbling for the future, and
not be too particular for the present and so miss the opportunity
offered. Let us tell the Government that we are ready. That will be
worthy of us. I now request Advocate Mr. Bejanji to move the first
resolution.
Concluding, Gandhiji said:

Before dissolving the meeting, I thank you and the organisers.
One thing more: I wanted to make a suggestion concerning
collections for the Gokhale Fund, a suggestion which I have made
elsewhere. Those who are ready to work as volunteers for this purpose
should now post themselves at the gate, and anyone who wants to pay
something may give it to them. If this is done, the credit for it will go
to Surat. I have with me the resolution 3 of which Mr. Thakoreram
wanted a translation. I shall send the translation on to him and he can
publish it with necessary changes.

HEADQUARTERS, KARACHI
March 2, 1917
In the course of the day (2nd instant), Gandhi visited the Home Rule League
Headquarters twice. On both occasions he spoke to the members, associates and
college students on passive resistance and austerity. The love of dress, which Gandhi
has noticed among Sindhis, has impressed him unfavourably. One of the members
asked him why he went about bare-footed. He replied that unless he maintained
austerity, he could not expect the masses to believe in his sincerity. He said that India
was too poor and that those who could afford to spend money on dress should refrain
from spending it in that way and give it to the poor. Jethmal 1 , of the Hindvasi,
questioned him about passive resistance and Gandhi explained its value by examples
from his South African experiences.
He also visited the Hardevi Bai Girls’ Schools and said a few words to the
children on education.
He met the Cutchhi and Gujarati community at the Parsi Theatre in the
afternoon and told them about indentured labour.

244. SPEECH AT PARSI THEATRE, KARACHI
March 2, 1917
On his visit, Mr. Gandhi made a definite pronouncement with regard to the
duty of Indians to join the Defence of India Force in the Parsi Theatre public meeting,
Karachi. He said that lndians had been pressing for admission in the army, time and
again, and now as the permission had been granted, they should join in
overwhelming numbers, and thus fulfil their duty to the Motherland. Mr. Gandhi said
that, in speaking as he had done, he had spoken not as a Passive Resister, but as one
claiming to know the Indian mind and understanding India’s present conditions. He
held very strong views about the use of weapons even in self-defence but he knew that
his views were not shared by those of his countrymen who had for years past been
agitating for the reform that had now come. It is an opportunity of a life-time that no
lover of his country should miss. Sir Satyendra Sinha 2 , in his Presidential address,

laid stress firstly and chiefly on this point. Sir Krishna Gupta exhorted Indians to
first demand entrance in the army, and now as the door had been opened, if they did
not avail themselves of this golden opportunity, they would disgrace themselves,
their leaders and their country. Business men ought not to allow their business to
stand in the way of their duty. Rather, should they know that after all they would be
protecting their own business in protecting their own country. If the enemy took
possession of their country, because they did not care or were unable to defend it,
their business would pass. In Mr. Gandhi’s opinion, this Bill 1 was the first
instalment of swaraj, and if they rejected the Government’s advances, they would be
rejecting swaraj. It should be accepted unconditionally. It would be time enough, after
the whole-hearted acceptance of the scheme, to attack its defects and to purge it of
them.

the system of indentured labour. The Hon’ble Mr. Harchandrai, President of the

M. K. Gandhi arrived after the time fixed and informed the audience that he
could not attend throughout as he had to catch the mail train to Calcutta, having been
invited by the Maharaja of Cassimbazar to be present in that city on the 6th instant.
After speaking in Hindi for half an hour, he left the Hall.
He began by requesting the assembly to send a telegram of condolence to A.
M. Kachalia, who had just lost his nephew 2 , and explained how much Mr. Kachalia
had done for Indians in South Africa. Gandhi then spoke on indentured labour. After
mentioning the various evils of the system, he told the audience that Indians must
insist on its abolition by the 31st of May this year. If their request were not acceded
to, all practical steps should be taken to prevent Indians from leaving the country for
labour in Fiji. Every effort should be made to teach the people to hate the system and
to clamour for its suppression.

246. SPEECH AT ANTI-INDENTURE MEETING,
CALCUTTA
March 6, 1917
At a public meeting held at the Town Hall, Calcutta, on March 6, 1917, under
the presidentship of Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi, Gandhiji made a statement on
indentured emigration to South Africa.
Mr. M. K. Gandhi, in seconding the resolution moved by the chair, said they
all expressed their sympathy to Mahomed Kachalia who had recently lost his son.
Mr. Kachalia was the president of the Transvaal British Indian Association. He was
one of the passive resisters and went to jail again and again. Mr. Gandhi said that the
Government did not allow Mr. Malaviya to introduce his Bill because the Government
wanted to introduce a measure which would satisfy the people. They all knew that the
Viceroy was in sympathy with them, but the Secretary of State for India was opposed
to them. He was to weigh the interests of Colonial planters at [the cost?] of the
Indians in a scale of gold. Sitting at a long distance, the Secretary of State could not
understand the feeling of the Indians. India believed that Mr. Andrews’ report1 was
true. The planters had engaged their best men to go to England and they were pressing
for time. If India did not rise to the occasion, the planters would gain the day. It was
not the Secretary of State for India but the people who could say when this system
should be abolished and they fixed the 31st May for its abolition. They could not
contemplate with calmness the shifting of dates from season to season. It was their
duty to say that India could not tolerate this wrong a minute longer than the 31st
May. No substitute to be brought forward by the London Conference was acceptable
to India.

You must have by now grown an old hand there. Medh 2 and
Pragji will be with you in a few days so that you will feel the
atmosphere of India for some time longer yet.
Do not worry yourself but at the same time take proper
treatment for your cough. By way of treatment, deep breathing and a
teaspoonful of olive oil will suffice. You will be able to increase the
quantity by and by. It can be taken as it is, mixed with a tomato. If
you can give up tea, coffee and cocoa, that will help all the more in
getting rid of the cough completely. Think carefully about these
things and carry them out. Do not neglect deep breathing for any
reason. Keep up your studies in the way 1 have shown you. Do not
give up doing sums on any account. A few must be done every day. I
would advise you not to pass over any, believing that you know the
method. As you do more and more sums, both of the simple and the
difficult kind, you will grow more proficient. Do not be slack about
them. The same about Sanskrit, and finally, English. In regard to this
last, for the present ponder over what I have taught you from Ruskin.
Go on reading Lycidas3 and write to me about anything in it which
you may not understand.

will reply to you in English and will also correct your English and

251. OUR SYSTEM OF EDUCAT1ON
March, 24, 1917
It has become customary with us to judge whatever we do by
Western standards. We claim that oriental civilization is superior to the
occidental, but our behaviour is contrary to what we say. That is why
the education of Indian children has become hybrid. Our educational
institutions do not produce heirs to the traditions of our saints and
seers. It is very sad. I have been thinking on the matter for a long time
and I put before the readers the conclusions to which I have come.
No one will quarrel with the principle that pupils should be
imparted a general knowledge of the basic occupations of the
country. According to this principle, all our boys should be taught
farming and weaving, for nearly 95 per cent of the country’s
population is engaged in agriculture, while 90 per cent of these used
to be engaged in weaving.
So long as the educated among us do not pay attention to these
two important matters, we cannot have any idea of the misery of our
324

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

tens of millions of agriculturists and hundreds of thousands of
weavers, nor can there be any improvement in these two pursuits.
We shall not be able to do any work if our body is not healthy.
So it is necessary to educate boys in the principles of health and
hygiene right from childhood.
Dharma is the basis of everything. A correct knowledge of the
scriptures, however, is not possible without a knowledge of Sanskrit.
Therefore, every Hindu boy must also learn some Sanskrit. But I think
it is very difficult to establish gurukuls everywhere. General education
should end with the imparting of general knowledge. Special
arrangements can be made for boys who are endowed with
extraordinary capacities.
In teaching history and geography, the method followed by the
Government should be changed. In teaching these subjects, the
emphasis should generally be on knowledge concerning India. My
experience is that many a boy knows where Middlesex is but he has
no idea about Kathiawar or Sorath. In history they are given a
comprehensive knowledge of the United Kingdom, but our Shivaji
they consider merely a bandit.
Our boys can solve intricate mathematical problems but are
ignorant of simple arithmetic useful in business. They have very little
knowledge of the indigenous tables.
Instruction to pupils in all provinces should be given in their
mother tongue. Besides this, they should acquire knowledge of two or
three other Indian languages.
English should be taught only to a small number of boys and as
a foreign language. I am convinced that so long as we are not free of
our fondness for English, we cannot achieve real swaraj. Some friends
tell me that in the ordinary business of life, like travelling by train or
reading a telegram, we are at sea if we do not know English. But we
ourselves are responsible for this state of affairs. If through a feeling
of inferiority we ignore our religion, our serfdom will only become
worse. And millions of our brethren who are never likely to learn
English will be reduced to slaves and an unbridgeable gulf will form
between them and the English-educated.
The education that is in vogue has no impact on our homes
either, although as a rule the whole country should be influenced by
the lives of students. Even a little of perfume will spread its fragrance
all round. It should be so with the life of a student. In my opinion, the
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

325

key to swaraj lies not so much in the hands of the Government as in
our system of education.

content to suffer.
Miss Graham, that is the sister’s name, may be able at once to go

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have not written to you for the last 4 weeks. I have been
incessantly travelling. You will understand this when I tell you that out
of 24 days, I was for 17 nights in the train. Every mail day found me
out of reach of the mail steamer. And I was too preoccupied to
anticipate the mail day. The reason for this rush was the indenture
question which took up all my energy. The question is now
326

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

satisfactorily solved. The Viceroy has done nobly in the matter.
Your post has become most regular now. For weeks I have only
one letter. Health at the Ashram is now quite good. I have partly
found the key. Oil did not suit the inmates. From 1/2 lb. per day, I
have increased the quantity of milk to 19 lb. per day! Manilal and
Ramdas have gone to South Africa to replace Pragji who has returned
for his marriage. Maganlal, Devdas, Prabhudas and Maganlal’s children are the only old hands now remaining. Chhaganlal may come.
Harilal is getting on nicely at Calcutta. Jamnadas is at Rajkot. Revashankar, having finished his training as a weaver, has establi- shed
himself at Rajkot.
We have done no agriculture work yet as we have not yet
secured a piece of ground.
Polak is in India doing a good deal of travelling. He must have
written to you. I shall inquire.

April 4 [1917]1
DEAR MILLIE,

After having conferred with Mr. Ambalal, I have come to the
conclusion that it is no use relying on the Tyabjis. Ceilia will
definitely leave Bombay on the 6th instant. I am sending Mama of the
Ashram with her as far as Ooty. The extra expense is a trifle in comparison. Mama will travel in the servants’ compartment attached to the
1st and 2nd-class carriages. He is a most capable and resourceful man
for such purposes and he is a much-travelled man.
You will have wires from different places and you need have no
anxiety on this score.

there. It was good that I did not bring him here. The man 1 who has
brought me here doesn’t know anything. He has dumped me in
some obscure place. The master of the house is away and the
servants take us both to be beggars. They don’t even permit usthe use
of their latrine, not to speak of inviting us to meals. I take care to
provide myself with a stock of the things I need and so I have been
able to maintain complete indifference. I have swallowed a good
many insults and the queer situation here does not trouble me. If
things go on this way I am not likely to see Champaran. So far as I
can see, my guide can give me no help and I am in no position to find
my own way. In this condition, I cannot give you my address. Even if
I had brought anyone from there for help, he would only have been a
burden on me. In addition to carrying my own burden, I would have
had to carry his as well. I am only describing the uncertainty of my
position. None of you need feel anxious, for I am enjoying a kind of
solitude. The house is not so bad. There is facility for bathing and so

you will know by wire. Nobody need think of coming here and going

CHI. MAGANLAL,

I have already dropped you a postcard, which you will get along
with this. I wrote it immediately on receiving the order. Since
they have not yet arrested me, l am writing more in this. It is literally
true that I did not stop even to wash my face. The Police Inspector
[actually] said, “You may wash your face, etc., before you send your
reply”, while I said to myself, “I shall do so only after sending my
reply.” They arrested me when I was on my way to a village for
carrying on the inquiry. They then put me in a bullock-cart and were
taking me away. A senior police officer met us on the way and served
the order upon me. At first he only said, “The Collector wants you.”
I turned back saying nothing. I have refused to leave the District. The
penalty for this crime is six months’ imprisonment and a fine of Rs.
1,000. I am awaiting further developments.
Herewith the statement of accounts up to date. Let Chhaganlal
make the credit and debit entries accordingly. I have given the
necessary details. Prabhudas not being with me is a great comfort.
This part of the country is worth seeing. I shall describe it to
you when we meet. It is less hot than there. People are very poor.
What a sad plight for the region where Shri Ramachandra lived,
enjoyed himself and performed deeds of valour! To go to jail here
under such circumstances is a great joy to me. It suggests an
auspicious outcome.
I wish your work goes on with double speed. Carry on the
experiment of the school; teach the twelve or more students from
Kochrab or elsewhere. Purchase land, if all of you approve. If
Shastri’s land has sufficient water, I personally like it very much.

SIR,

With reference to the order2 under section 144 of the Criminal
Procedure Code just served upon me, I beg to state that I am sorry that
you have felt called upon to issue it and I am sorry too that the
Commissioner of the Division has totally misinterpreted my position.3
Out of a sense of public responsibility, I feel it to be my duty to say
that I am unable to leave this District but if it so pleases the authorities,
I shall submit to the order by suffering the penalty of disobedience.
I must emphatically repudiate the Commissioner’s suggestion
that my ‘object is likely to be agitation’. My desire is purely and
simply for a genuine search for knowledge. And this I shall continue

267. LETTER TO PRIVATE SECRETARY TO VICEROY
NOT FOR P UBLICATION

C ARE DISTRICT MAGISTRATE ,
MOTIHARI,

April 16, 1917
DEAR MR. MAFFEY2 ,

I have come to this district to learn for myself whether there is
truth in the allegations of the ryots against the planters. I saw the
Secretary of the Planters’ Association and then the Commissioner of
the Division 3 , and sought their co-operation. Both politely rejected my
advances and dissuaded me from my pursuit. I could not accept their
advice, and have been proceeding with my work. The Magistrate has
served upon me an order4 asking me to leave the District. The grounds
for the order are such as I cannot subscribe to. I have therefore been
reluctantly obliged to disobey the order and tell the magistrate that I
shall suffer the penalty for the breach.5
My motive is national service and that, too, so long as it is
consistent with humanitarian dictates. I understand, because my South
African work was considered to be humanitarian that I was awarded.
the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal.6 So long as my humanitarian motive is
questioned, so long must I remain undeserving of holding the medal.

I am therefore asking my people to return the medal to you, 1 and I
shall feel honoured to receive it back if it is returned to me when my
motive is no longer questioned.
As to the question itself, so far as I have been able to examine
the evidence, given to me, it shows that the planters have successfully
used the Civil and Criminal Courts and illegal force to enrich
themselves at the expense of the ryots, and that the ryots are living
under a reign of terror and that their property, their persons, and their
minds are all ‘under the planters’ heels. One man graphically said to
me: “We belong to the planters, not to the Sircar2 . Thana 3 is nowhere,
the planters are everywhere. We take what they allow, and we keep
what they permit.” I had hoped that a deeper examination would have
toned down the impression formed by me. Had I been left free, I
would have concluded my studies and placed the results at the
disposal of the authorities. I wish that His Excellency would consider
the matter serious enough to have an independent inquiry made. The
local administration admit that they are sitting upon a mine so
dangerous that they cannot tolerate my presence. And yet they
manage to be satisfied with the slow inquiry of a settlement officer.
Everything will depend upon swiftness and the proper choice of the
members of the Committee of Inquiry. This is the least that the ryots
are entitled to. Will you please place this before the Viceroy and ask
for his forgiveness for sending such a long letter in the midst of many
imperative calls upon his time. The urgency of the matter is the sole
excuse for this letter.
I am, etc.,

268. INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKERS1
[April 16, 1917] 2
The programme of study should be gone through as if I was not
imprisoned, that is
1. Villages should be visited systematically and notes of
evidence of everyone examined should be taken.
2. Where the party consents to sign the notes, his signature or
thumb impression should be taken.
3. Evidence should be taken even where the parties decline to
sign. Reason for refusal should be noted.
4. Evidence of pleaders who had anything to do with the case of
the ryots should be requested and it should be after the pattern
suggested for Gorakh Babu3 .
For this, evidence as many workers as would come forward
should be taken. It is to be wished that many workers who would
come forward would not be deterred from pursuing their inquiry even
though they may receive notice of removal.
They should quietly go to gaol if they are summoned and tried
for disobedience. I suggest that no defence be offered.
The ryots should be instructed definitely not to use violence
whether regarding their own grievances or regarding imprisonment of
those who may come to assist them. But they can be and should be
told that where they know they are being unjustly treated, that is,
required to plant indigo when they need not, rather than go to law,
they should simply refuse to plant indigo and if for so refusing they
are imprisoned they should suffer imprisonment. This requires very
careful explanation. Where the workers do not understand the
working of this quiet resistance or do not appreciate the force of it,
they may drop this point of the programme.
When the workers of this first class are exhausted or not found
at all, second class workers should be enlisted to collect evidence at

centres where their presence is not resented. Ryots may be quietly
asked to come to such centres and give evidence. All documents
should be collected and classified. The work ought not to take more
than six weeks. At the end of the inquiry the whole of the evidence
oral or documentary should be printed for private circulation. In the
first instance if no one will print it, it should be typed. All the papers
and evidence should be collected at one spot and sifted and marshalled under one man’s direction. Babu Brijkishore Prasad 1 should
take it up unless Mr. Andrews arrives and does the marshalling.
Further action should be taken after consultation with a small
all-India committee under Panditjee2 or Mr. Shastri3 . There should be
a demand for an impartial inquiry containing a number (equal with
that of the planters’ representatives) of Indians representing the ryots.
Our representatives must be of our choice.
Pending inquiry planters should institute no civil suits for
damages, etc., and an impartial person should be present at the time of
distribution of wages daily or otherwise.
Workers should be paid where necessary. If funds cannot be
raised locally, the Imperial Citizenship Association should be asked.

papers ought to have gone to Bankipore last night. But they did not
somehow. I am now sending you a special messenger. Please show
them to Muzharul Haque1 too. He has telegraphed offering to come if
required. I have replied saying he may come after my imprisonment.
Whilst I am free, I want only volunteers who will go from village to
village and hear what the people have to say.
From the memorandum of instructions2 hurriedly drawn up last
night you will observe what is wanted. Two things may be done by the
leaders there: urgent demand for an impartial quick inquiry, a body
of staunch learned volunteers (100) who would go to different villages
and live there protecting the people from molestation and gathering
information. If the authorities object to the volunteers, they should not
take ‘no’ for an answer. The volunteers should be, so far as possible,
Beharees. Theirs should be the credit.
I still feel that so far as you are concerned, you need not throw
yourself into the fray. I have asked Andrews to come. I want you to
feel free and prepared to go to England and settle there. I cannot go
into all the reasons just now.
Gorakh Prasad Babu here will give you all the information
during my absence. If there is no summons I disappear in the villages
tomorrow and may not return for two days.
With love,
Yours,

MY DEAR FRIEND 1 ,

I read your affection in your eyes, in your expression, in

know you want to help. You shall have your choice. Either go to
Ahmedabad and work there for the experimental school or come and
work here even at the risk of imprisonment. All this if I am
imprisoned. If you want me to choose for you seeing that you are
here, your natural place is not to quit the place until the ryots have
their freedom to breathe like men. For me now Champaran is my
domicile. Every day’s inquiry confirms me in my opinion that the
position in many respects is worse than in Fiji.
There is no summons yet for contempt.

276. STATEMENT BEFORE THE COURT
[MOTIHARI,]

April 18, 1917
Mr. Gandhi appeared before the District Magistrate on
Wednesday, the 18th instant. He read the statement printed below, and
being asked to plead and finding that the case was likely to be
unnecessarily prolonged, pleaded guilty. The Magistrate would not
award the penalty but postponed judgement till 3 p.m. Meanwhile he
was asked to see the Superintendent and then the District Magistrate.
The result was that he agreed not to go out to the villages, pending
instructions from the Government as to their view of his mission. The
case was then postponed up to Saturday, April 21.With the permission
of the Court, I would like to make a brief statement showing why I
have taken the very serious step of seemingly disobeying the order
made under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. In my
humble opinion, it is a question of difference of opinion between the
local administration and myself. I have entered the country with
motives of rendering humanitarian and national service. I have done
so in response to a pressing invitation’ to come and help the ryots,
who urge they are not being fairly treated by the indigo planters. I
could not render any help without studying the problem. I have,
therefore, come to study it with the assistance, if possible, of the
administration and the planters. I have no other motive and I cannot
believe that my coming here can in any way disturb the public peace
or cause loss of life. I claim to have considerable experience in such
matters. The administration, however, have thought differently. I fully
appreciate their difficulty, and I admit too, that they can only proceed
upon information they receive. As a law-abiding citizen, my first
instinct would be, as it was, to obey the order served upon me. I could
not do so without doing violence to my sense of duty to those for
whom I have come. I feel that I could just now serve them only by
remaining in their midst. I could not, therefore, voluntarily retire.
Amid this conflict of duty, I could only throw the responsibility of
removing me from them on the administration.
I am fully conscious of the fact that a person, holding in the
public life of India a position such as I do, has to be most careful in
setting examples. It is my firm belief that in the complex constitution
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

345

under which we are living, the only safe and honourable course for a
self-respecting man is, in the circumstances such as face me, to do
what I have decided to do, that is, to submit without protest to the
penalty of disobedience. I have ventured to make this statement not in
any way in extenuation of the penalty to be awarded against me, but
to show that I have disregarded the order served upon me, not for
want of respect for lawful authority, but in obedience of the higher
law of our being—the voice of conscience.1

will now go to Fiji.

that Government officials have been asked to co-operate with me

taking cooked food from today. Fruit diet seems very expensive. there
is scarcity of fruit even in such a fertile land.
I do not see any chance of my going back in the immediate
future. It may be that I shall have to spend six months here. It is
another matter that I may go over there briefly for a day or two. In
that eventuality we have to consider whether anyone should come
here. Whoever comes cannot hope to study. He can only gain
experience of the place. In my view, nobody need come. I am able to
get whatever help I need. I feel that it is essential that the activities of
the Ashram should be carried on well. But I would not interfere.
Should anyone decide to come here, he should consider his step from
all angles. I think it would be best to withdraw the amount that stands
in my name in the bank and credit it to Chhaganlal’s account.

you about the matter, I could not be blamed for having told the
aggrieved parties that there was a probability of their getting back
their guns. This, if anything, was done to create a good impression
about yourself— an impression which, I am happy to say, I carried
with me [when] I first met you and which I have had no reason to

change since. There was certainly no interference on my part with
your authority.
I venture to think that your deduction, too, that in the estimation
of the raiyats I am superseding local authority is hardly warranted by
facts. My mission is to invoke the help of local authority in their aid,
and to stimulate its interest in them more fully than heretofore.
I anticipate no trouble, because I always make it a point to seek
an interview with the planters wherever I go, to tell the people that
relief is to come not from me but from the planters and the
Government, and that they are in no case to use violence or stop work
but continue it as before as if there was no enquiry being made by me,
and also because the enquiry is absolutely open and attended by
representatives of the police department, as also the planters.
You are less than fair to Babu Brajkishore Prasad. Together with
other friends from Bihar, he is helping me very materially. In this
enquiry he has no status apart from me: hence he and the other
friends have not called on you. But I must state that their assistance
has been of the greatest value to me.
Perhaps it is but fair to the planters to say that Mr. Still1 has of
his own motion invited me to visit his dehat2 and remain there aslong
as I like and that Mr. Cox has written to me saying that he is arranging
a meeting with some leading planters, and concludes “you may be
sure that we wish to assist you in your enquiry”. This perhaps is in
conflict with your statement, “By the planters he (I) is regarded with
great suspicion as their natural enemy.”
I wish to serve my countrymen and the planters through the
Government where their assistance is necessary.
Yours truly,

April 29 [1917] 1
DEAR DR. DEVA,

Your Geography is at fault. This is not Assam. This is North
Bihar. This is the land of Janak to which Vishwamitra took those two
youngsters, Rama and Lakshman. Nature’s bounty has been lavished
as unstintingly as man has abused his power. The position is so bad
that I dare not leave here even for a day. I have cancelled
all appointments. I cannot be with you in Nasik, much as I should like
to be.
We are taking the statements of men who come to us as fast as
we can. In a few days, I may have something to report. I have kept
Mr. Shastriar supplied with all the information to date.
Although I am not in gaol, I shall still look up to you to
finish the programme about the translation of Mr. Gokhale’s
speeches.
Yours sincerely,

friend.1 Yes, I have felt anxious about him these months having heard
nothing from or of him. I have been writing most regularly to him.
He gave me, when his departure was imminent, his new address and I
wrote several letters to that address. Having received no
acknowledgement of these letters I resumed writing to his Douglas
address. But I have practically no acknowledgment of all these letters
of mine. Pray tell him that we all think of him and miss him so often.
I miss him most of all. Just now I am in the northern part of India. It
is a country “Where every prospect pleases, man alone is vile.”2 Here
at first my presence was resented by the local authority. I received a
summons to leave the country. I declined. I was summoned to answer
a charge of contempt. I pleaded guilty. But the court had not the
courage to sentence me. Meanwhile came instructions from the
superior authority that the proceedings against me should be
withdrawn and that I should be allowed to proceed with my work. My
work is to examine the condition of the peasantry who are working
under the indigo planters who are alleged to be treating the peasantry
in a most high-handed manner. I have been carrying on my inquiry
and I find the position to be as bad as it was painted. I am still going
on with the inquiry. It is here I miss our friend’s presence. I cannot
imagine myself doing this class of work without him. I know he would
have been delighted to be in the thick of it. He would have walked
with me to the villages and lived with me among the simple folk. He
would have seen the planters. He would have made friends with them
and would have played an important part in bringing about a
settlement. But that was not to be. He must pay the penalty that
modern civilization exacts from us —man against man to gain man’s
so-called freedom. It is like darkness being used to dispel darkness.
We are living in an age of materialism. We are always hoping for the
best to happen though unconsciously doing the opposite to achieve
the best. I hope with you that the agony will soon end. But the hope is
against my reason. My reason tells me that the peace which we shall
have will be mockery; it will be an armed truce to me, it will be the
outcome not of one party admitting being in the wrong but both
being fairly exhausted and deserving rest. Such a peace is bound to

not forgetful of the distress you are passing through there. We are
only a glimpse of what you are going through. I wish that all this
great sacrifice had been made for a better cause. But nature has her
own ways. Good often comes out of evil. Let us hope it will in this
case also.
I am glad our friend is flourishing so far as his bodily health
goes. Pray tell him not to worry over his South African affairs. He left
them in the best hands available and there they must rest. The
circumstances that will face him on his release will provide their own
remedy.
I hope you will make sure of this reaching our friend even if it
means your having to go to him. If you will give me the privilege of
paying for your journey, I should be gald to do so.
Now that you have commenced writing, I hope you will allow
yourself to be the link between our friend and me. Unless there is
anything of importance I shall not write to you until I hear from you.
To make sure of this reaching you, I am having the letter sent by
registeres post.
Thanking you most sincerely for having written to me about our
friend.

I have your letter. If you feel it is necessary for you to go to
Madhavpur for the sake of your health, do go. Ahmedabad would be
very hot these days. Will Krishna have to accompany you or will he
stay behind? It will take time for you to get rid of the weakness. At the
moment I cannot advise you to take porridge of boiled fruits. There is
nothing wrong in your taking almonds. The more you worry about
gaining strength enough to do your work, the more time you will take
to get well. Come to Ahmedabad as soon as it starts raining there. . . 2

I have just received your letter from Ahmedabad. To say ‘I
thank you’ would be in your case an empty form. Your interest is
much deeper. My experiences here give the greatest joy. The
suffering I see around me gives me equal pain. I know that you feel
for me because you would like to be in the thick of it all yourself. But
your work is cut out for you. For those who are at a distance from
you, you can but pray. And that you are doing with all your heart.
I may not be able to leave this place for six months. One of
these days, I shall describe to you the nature of the work I am doing
here.
Do please go to the Ashram whenever you can. It is one of your

I think it is a very important experiment. 1 should like you to see
Prof. Shah and start work immediately. Write to Mr. Sadashiv to tell
him that he may possibly be needed. I will call him up then. Is he
ready to come along with his family? He must give at least six months.
Perhaps more.
If Shastri’s plot is not otherwise inconvenient and the water
there is good, it should be secured without any delay. Do you think it
will be possible to put up tents or thatched huts while Construction
work is under way? I don’t care if the analyst’s report on the soil is
not favourable. The water must be good. For the school, we want 12 to
20 pupils for the present. It will be better if they are drawn from good
families. Rather, let them be what they are. If it is decided to settle on
Shastri’s plot, boys from adjoining villages may be invited. However,
so long as we can get them from Ahmedabad city, it will be preferable
not to bring in villagers to join the experiment. But one need not be
particular in this matter; we should carry on with any boys who may
join.
If the teacher has any real worth in him, the mechanical side of
education will take care of itself. If they tell stories from the
Ramayana, everyone will follow them as well as he can. In agriculture,
they will acquire equal proficiency. Spiritual awakening will require [a
mind disposed that way through] early influences. How can we know
whether we shall come upon such influences in cities or villages?
Show this to Prof. Shah and request him on my behalf to take up this
work in all earnestness. I shall write to him if I find time.
Kripalani is in Muzaffarpur. He wanted to know from me
what he should do. I told him1 that, since he was here, he should join

DEAR MILLIE,

Your letter and wire were redirected here and come into my
hands today. Henceforth, please write at the above address. Simply
Bettiah, Champaran will do.
I am sorry to hear the news about Henry’s illness. Somehow I
do not share your gloomy forebodings. He has marvellous
recuperative powers and I think he will quickly recover his original
vigour. What I do feel, however, is that both of you should join Ceilia
at Ooty. Mama too wrote saying that Ceilia was not keeping well. But I
go further to say that even if she were well, she ought not alone to
have charge of a child, especially a child so wonderful as Leon. Ooty
will do Henry good and may do you also good. If the high altitude
does not suit you all, you should go to Bangalore. It has perhaps the
finest climate in India. Even Belgaum or Poona will be alright for

you. But somehow or other, I prefer Banglore. Change to any such
place will be the best tonic for Henry. And he must live on the plainest
foods such as we have at the Ashram. Everything simply boiled.
As for Waldo, I must differ from your views. It is because Waldo
is a trust that you may not play with him. I would not mind your
being vaccinated if you chose to be. But to add a weakness-causing
operation to an already weak constitution is to do infinite harm to it. It
is not obligatory on you to travel or to live in insanitary surroundings.
By all means take all reasonable precautions that the science of
hygiene may suggest. If the worst fear is realized and Waldo has
smallpox, why should you consider yourself guilty? It is not a
dangerous disease. And natural smallpox if properly treated does not
leave the patient debilitated. But the purest lymph is not as pure as
you may imagine. By having him vaccinated, you will expose Waldo
to an additional risk to his health. Pock marks, if you are afraid of
them, are really nothing. By proper treatment, in course of time they
disappear. Did you see Bala and Naransamy? They had confluent
smallpox of the most virulent type. The marks are growing or were
growing fainter daily under the treatment of anointing with oil and
rubbing thereafter. Pray read my plan for Waldo twice, then pray and
then do as the voice within you bids you.
Do please write to me frequently if you cannot write to me daily
about Henry’s health. It is God’s mercy that when every member of
the family is down, you are keeping well. I do hope you won’t have a
nervous breakdown after Henry rises from his sick-bed which he will
soon do, I am sure.
My work is steadily progressing. I have come in touch with
many planters too and often meet the collector, etc. I cannot leave this
place for some months to come.
With love to you all,
Yours,

MY DEAR MILLIE,

Just a line before leaving for Bettiah. Your telegram of yesterday
has frightened me. Immediately on receipt of your wire, I wrote to
you a long letter about Henry and Ceilia. I do still hope that [you]
have received it. The postal hours in Bettiah are most inconvenient. I
have to trust to chance friends to post the letters and it is possible that
the one who takes the letter might have missed the post for which my
letter to you was intended.
It alarms me to find that fever has not yet left Henry and I have
telegraphed to you to wire or write to me at Bettiah.
I came in yesterday on the invitation of the Government to see
Hon’ble Mr. Maude 2 . I had two hours’ interview. I shall write more
about this later. The matter is critical. I dare not gone down to you.
Please use the wire freely if necessary. I shall expect at least a postcard
from you daily.

I had been waiting for a letter from you, as one waits for the
rains. I got one and I am satisfied. The same post brought a letter of
yours sent on by Narandas. I shall keep on writing to you. I shall be
measured by your success. If you should not come up to my
expectations, my judgment would be rated at zero; I have staked so
much on you. My conscience would also tell me that I am not at all a
good judge of men. You will therefore always have my blessings and
my encouragement. I pray God may give you all necessary strength.
If the two of you live an ideal life, you will be the saving of many a
young man. It is very much my desire that all of you, on whom I have
placed my hopes, should be not merely what I am but free of all my
faults, that you may do better than I. There will be nothing wrong in
your aiming so high. It is not much of a miracle that a son should
preserve the capital, what pleases the father more and brings greater
credit to himself is that he should add to it.
For some time yet I shall have no choice but to stay on here.
You must be getting all the news through Doctor Saheb, so I don’t
give any here. If the food there does not disagree with you, be in no
hurry to make too many changes in it. Your duty at present is to see
that you flourish in health and that you teach the boys and raise them

300. LETTER TO ESTHER FAERING
BETTIAH,

May 13, 1917
MY DEAR ESTHER,

Pray do not apologize for writing to me. Your letters are most
welcome.
I am sure that your duty is to fulfil your undertaking with the
Mission with all your heart. You can come to the Ashram only when
they relieve you and when you feel in the clearest possible terms that
you will come to render the service of humanity in greater fullness.
When that time comes, the Ashram will receive you as one of its own.
Meanwhile you are of course always free to go [to] the Ashram and
stay there as long as you like.
At the Ashram, we are now trying an experiment in education to
serve as a pattern. When you go there, I am sure you will like the
teaching staff. They are all, I think, good men and sane.
My work here gives me greater and greater joy day by day. The
poor raiyats delight in simply sitting round me, feeling that they can
trust me to do the right thing. I only hope I am worthy of all this love.
I constantly see the planters and do not despair of appealing to their
sense of justice on behalf of the raiyats who have groaned under the
weight of oppression all these long years. I shall send you a copy of
my representation1 to the Government. You may not understand some
points in it. Do not hesitate to ask me please.

301. REPORT ON CONDITION OF RYOTS IN CHAMPARAN1
BETTIAH,

May 13, 1917
In accordance with the suggestions made by Hon’ble Mr.
Maude2 , I beg to submit herewith the preliminary conclusions which I
have arrived at as a result of the inquiry being made by me into the
agrarian condition of the raiyats of Champaran.
At the outset I would like to state that it was not possible
for me to give the assurance which Mr. Maude would have liked me to
have given, viz., that the vakil friends who have been assisting me
would be withdrawn. I must confess that this request has hurt me
deeply. It has been made ever since my arrival here. I have been told,
that is, after the withdrawal of the order of removal from the District,
that my presence was harmless enough and that my bona fides were
unquestioned, but that the presence of the vakil friends was likely to
create ‘a dangerous situation’. I venture to submit that if I may be
trusted to conduct myself decorously, I may be equally trusted to
choose helpers of the same type as myself. I consider it a privilege to
have the association, in the difficult tasks before me, of these able,
earnest and honourable men. It seems to me that for me to abandon
them is to abandon my work. It must be a point of honour with me
not to dispense with their help until anything unworthy is proved
against them to my satisfaction. I do not share the fear that either my
presence or that of my friends can create ‘a dangerous situation’. The
danger, if any exists, must lie in the causes that have brought about
strained relations between the planters and the raiyats. And if the
causes were removed, there never need be any fear of a dangerous
situation arising in Champaran so far as the raiyats are concerned.
Coming to the immediate purpose of this representation, I beg
to state that nearly four thousand raiyats have been examined and
their statements taken after careful cross-examination. Several villages
have been visited and many judgments of courts studied. And the
inquiry is, in my opinion, capable of sustaining the following

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

conclusions:
Factories or concerns in the district of Champaran may be
divided into two classes—(1) those that have never had indigo
plantations, and (2) those that have:—
(1)

(2)

The concerns which have never grown indigo have
exacted abwabs known by various local names equal in
amount at least to the rent paid by the raiyats. This exaction,
although it has been held to be illegal, has not altogether
stopped.

The indigo-growing factories have grown indigo
either under the tinkathia system or khuski. The former has
been most prevalent and has caused the greatest hardship.
The type has varied with the progress of time. Starting with
indigo, it has taken in its sweep all kinds of crops. It may now
be defined as an obligation presumed to attach to the raiyat’s
holding whereby the raiyat has to grow a crop on 3/20 of the
holding at the will of the landlord for a stated consideration.
There appears to be no legal warrant for it. The raiyats have
always fought against it and have only yielded to force. They
have not received adequate consideration for the services.
When, however, owing to the introduction of synthetic indigo
the price of the local product fell, the planters desired to
cancel the indigo sattas1 . They, therefore, devised a means of
saddling the losses upon the raiyats. In lease-hold lands they
made the raiyats pay tawan, i.e., damages to the extent of Rs.
100/- per bigha in consideration of their waiving their right
toindigo cultivation. This, the raiyats claim, was done under
coercion. Where the raiyats could not find cash, hand-notes
and mortgage bonds were made for payment in instalments
bearing interest at 12 per cent per annum. In these the
balance due has not been described as tawan, i.e., damages,
but it has been fictitiously treated as an advance to the raiyat
for some purpose of his own.

In mukarrari 2 lands, the damage has taken the shape of
sharahbeshi sattas, meaning enhancement of rent in lieu of indigo
cultivation. The enhancement according to the survey report has in
1
2

A permanent tenure.

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

367

the case of 5,955 tenancies amounted to Rs. 31,062, the
pre-enhancement figure being Rs. 53,865. The total number of
tenancies affected is much larger. The raiyats claim that these sattas
were taken from them under coercion. It is inconceivable that the
raiyats would agree to an enormous perpetual increase in their rents
against freedom from liability to grow indigo for a temporary period
which freedom they were strenuously fighting to secure and hourly
expecting.
Where tawan has not been exacted, the factories have forced the
raiyats to grow oats, sugarcane, or such other crops under the
tinkathia system.
Under the tinkathia system, the raiyat has been obliged to give
his best land for the landlord’s crops; in some cases the land in front
of his house has been so used; he has been obliged to give his best
time and energy also to it, so that very little time has been left to him
for growing his own crops—his means of livelihood.
Cart-hire sattas have been forcibly taken from the raiyats for
supplying carts to the factories on hire insufficient even to cover the
actual outlay.
Inadequate wages have been paid to the raiyats whose labour
has been impressed, and even boys of tender age have been made to
work against their will.
Ploughs of the raiyats have been impressed and detained by the
factories for days together for ploughing factory lands for a trifling
consideration and at a time when they required them for cultivating
their own lands.
Dasturi 1 has been taken by the notoriously ill-paid factory
amlas 2 out of the wages received by the labourers, often amounting to
a fifth of their daily wage, and also out of the hire paid for carts and
ploughs.
In some villages, the chamars3 have been forced to give up to
the factories the hides of dead cattle belonging to the raiyats. Against
the carcases the chamars used to supply the raiyats with shoes and
leather straps for ploughs and their women used to render services to
the latter’s families at child-birth. Now they have ceased to render

these valuable services. Some factories have for the collection of such
hides opened hides godowns.
Illegal fines—often of heavy amounts—have been imposed by
factories upon raiyats who have proved unbending.
Among the other (according to the evidence before me)
methods adopted to bend the raiyats to their will, the planters have
impounded the raiyats’ cattle, posted peons on their houses,
withdrawn from them barbers’, dhobis’, carpenters’, and smiths’
services; have prevented the use of village wells and pasture lands by
ploughing up the pathway and lands just in front of or behind their
homesteads, have brought or promoted civil suits, or criminal
complaints against them, and resorted to actual physical force and
wrongful confinements. The planters have successfully used the
institutions of the country to enforce their will against the raiyats and
have not hesitated to supplement them by taking the law in their own
hands. The result has been that the raiyats have shown an abject
helplessness such as I have not witnessed in any part of India where I
have travelled.
They are members of District Boards and assessors under the
Chaukidari Act and keepers of pounds. Their position as such has
been felt by the raiyats. The roads which the latter pay for at the rate
of half an anna per rupee of rent paid by them are hardly available to
them. Their carts and bullocks which perhaps most need the roads are
rarely allowed to make use of them. That this is not peculiar to
Champaran does not in any way mitigate the grievance.
I am aware that there are concerns which form exceptions to the
rule laid down, but as a general charge the statements made above are
capable of proof.
I am aware, too, that there are some Indian zamindars who are
open to the charges made above. Relief is sought for in their cases as
in those of the planters. Whilst there can be no doubt the latter
have inherited a vicious system, they with their trained minds
and superior position have reduced it to an exact science, so that the
raiyats would not only have been unable to raise their heads above
water but would have sunk deeper still had not the Government
granted some protection. But that protection has been meagre and
provokingly slow and has often come too late to be appreciated by the
raiyats.

It is true that the Government await the Settlement Officer’s
report on some of the matters covered by this representation. It is
submitted that when the raiyats are groaning under the weight of
oppression, such as I have described above, an inquiry by the
Settlement Officer is a cumbersome method. With him the grievances
mentioned herein are but an item in an extensive settlement operation.
Nor does his inquiry cover all the points raised above. Moreover,
grievances have been set forth herein which are not likely to be
disputed. And they are so serious as to require immediate relief.
That tawan and sharahbeshi sattas and abwabs have been
exacted cannot be questioned. I hope it will not be argued that the
raiyats can be fully protected as to these by recourse to law. It is
submitted that where there is wholesale exaction, courts are not a
sufficient protection for the raiyats and the administrative protection
of the Sarkar1 as the supreme landlord is an absolute necessity.
The wrongs are twofold. There are wrongs which are
accomplished facts and wrongs which continue. The continuing
wrongs need to be stopped at once and a small inquiry may be made
as to past wrongs, such as damages and abwabs already taken and
sharahbeshi payments already made. The raiyats should be told by
proclamation and notices distributed broadcast among them that they
are not only not bound to pay abwabs, tawan and sharahbeshi
charges but that they ought not to pay them, that the Sarkar will
protect them if any attempt is made to enforce payment thereof. They
should further be informed that they are not bound to render any
personal service to their landlords and that they are free to sell their
services wherever they choose and that they are not bound to grow
indigo, sugar-cane or any other crop unless they wish to do so and
unless it is profitable for them. The Bettiah Raj leases given to the
factories should not be renewed until the wrongs are remedied and
should, when renewed, properly safeguard the raiyats’ rights.
As to dasturi, it is clear that better paid and educated men
should substitute the present holders of responsible offices and that no
countenance should be given to the diminution in raiyats’ wages by
illegal exaction of dasturi. I feel sure that the planters are quite
capable of dealing with the evil, although it is in their language ‘as old
as the Himalayas’.

The raiyats being secured in their freedom, it would be no
longer necessary to investigate the question of the inadequacy or
otherwise of the consideration in the indigo sattas and cart-hire sattas,
and the wages. The raiyats by common agreement should be advised
to finish indigo or other crops for the current year. But thenceforth,
whether it is indigo or any other crop, it should be only under a
system of absolute free-will.
It will be observed that I have burdened this statement with as
little argument as possible. But if it is the desire of the Government
that I should prove any of my conclusions, I shall be pleased to tender
the proofs on which they are based.
In conclusion, I would like to state that I have no desire to hurt
the planters’ feelings. I have received every courtesy from them.
Believing as I do that the raiyats are labouring under a grievous
wrong from which they ought to be freed immediately, I have dealt, as
calmly as is possible for me to do so, with the system which the
planters are working. I have entered upon my mission in the hope that
they as Englishmen born to enjoy the fullest personal liberty and
freedom will not fail to rise to their status and will not begrudge the
raiyats the same measure of liberty and freedom.
I am sending copies to the Commissioner of the Tirhut Division,
the Collector of Champaran, the Subdivisional Officer of Bettiah, the
Manager of the Bettiah Raj, the Secretaries, respectively, of the Bihar
Planters’ Association and the District Planters’ Association. I am
circulating them also among those leaders of public opinion in the
country who have kept themselves in touch with the work being done
by my colleagues and myself. The copies are being marked not for
publication, as there is no desire to invite a public discussion of the
question unless it becomes absolutely necessary.
I need hardly give the assurance that I am at the disposal of the
Government whenever my presence may be required.

302. NOTES ON THE POSITION IN CHAMPARAN TO DATE 1
BETTIAH,

May 14, 1917
CONFIDENTIAL

Since the withdrawal of the order of the Magistrate served on
Mr. Gandhi, the work of recording statements has continued without
interruption. Nearly 4000 statements have been taken. Rayats have
flocked to the two stations, Motihari and Bettiah. The rush has been so
great that the volunteers have not been able to cope with the work
from day to day.
The volunteers are all local pleaders who have performed their
work with great zeal and devotion. Babu Brajakishore Prasad has
superintended this part of the work. The names of the other volunteers
are: Babu Rajendra Prasad2 , Babu Dharanidhar3 , Babu Gorakh Prasad,
Babu Ramnawami Prasad4 , Babu Sambhusaran 5 and Babu Anugrah
Narain Sinha6 . Chance comers have also assisted occasionally. Several
villages have been visited and hundreds of rayats have been seen in
their homes.
Planters have been always invited to attend the meetings with the
rayats. They have, however, not attended. Their jamadars7 have.
Planters have been individually seen by Mr. Gandhi and there was a
conference between representative planters and him. The planters were
quite courteous but uncompromising. They overstated their case,

inasmuch as they claimed that they had always acted as benefactors of
their rayats and that they had protected them from the rapacity of
moneylenders. Frequent interviews have taken place between the local
officials and Mr. Gandhi. The former have been more open than the
planters and have certainly shown a desire for amicable settlement.
The officials have never concealed their opinion that they did not
approve of the mission. Some of them only reluctantly carried out the
Government instructions to give Mr. Gandhi every facility. The result
has been that it has not been always an easy matter to obtain
information from them. They have expressed stronger disapproval of
the presence of the helpers mentioned above. The Sub-divisional
Officer at Bettiah often said 1 that he was afraid of a conflagration
taking place any day by reason of the inquiry. He said that the rayats
had grown bolder and had formed a highly exaggerated notion of the
results of the mission. He even reported to the Government that unless
the inquiry could be stopped, he could not be responsible for the
peace of the district under his charge. Some planters, too, went to
Ranchi to complain to the Government that they were afraid of their
own safety if the inquiry was continued. It was on account of this that
Mr. Gandhi was invited to meet Hon’ble Mr. Maude at Bankipur on
the 10th instant.
An outwork has been burnt down. 2 The planters grew nervous
and even suggested that it might be due to our inquiry. There seems
to be no connection between the fire and the inquiry.
Mr. Maude suggested3 that the inquiry might now usefully be
closed entirely and that Mr. Gandhi might submit his report to the
Government. and that if the inquiry could not be stopped, Mr. Gandhi
should withdraw the ‘pleader-friends’ from the district. Mr. Gandhi
stated that the inquiry could not be entirely stopped but that he had
advanced far enough to enable him to frame preliminary conclusions,
that he could not as a point of honour think of dispensing with the
help of the pleader-friends whom he considered to be as sober and
honourable as himself and who were of the greatest assistance to him
in his work. Mr. Maude was quite conciliatory in his conversation.

The enclosed representation1 is the result of the interview. The inquiry
continues except to the extent that, instead of statements
being recorded as heretofore by the volunteers, Mr. Gandhi will
himself, as soon as he is free to be able to do so, sit for a few hours
daily among the rayats and after hearing their statements2 record his
impressions.
The representation is deliberately an understatement. The
condition of the rayat is far worse than is pictured there. It is not
capable of being understood by a layman. The planters’ rule has
practically supplanted the rule of the local Government. Nobody has
the courage to speak up for the rayats. The latter do not readily get
the assistance of the local mukhtars3 . Many have privately come to Mr.
Gandhi and told him much worse stories of oppression than have been
recorded in the statements. In Fiji and Natal, the evil was represented
by a single law. The evil was dealt with, if the law could be removed.
In Champaran, the evil is like a weed growing everywhere and anyhow
and in growing has smothered all law and order. The very laws for the
protection of the rayats have been used by the planters to reduce them
to serfdom. As the planters have placed themselves above law, even
decrees of courts have had no binding effect on them in many cases.
The evil, therefore, will require a tremendous effort before it is
checked. No stone is being left unturned to induce the planters to do
justice without the necessity of a great and very serious public
agitation. The desire is, by inviting the Government to deal with the
planters firmly, to avoid the publication of a report which is bound to
stagger India. Public men and women of India will never be able to sit
still if the report has ever to be published until the wrongs it will
narrate are remedied. The mere narration is calculated to rouse
passions and therefore every effort is being made to bring about a
settlement without any public agitation.
If the settlement comes or even if it does not, it is necessary to
post volunteers in villages to act as links between the planters and
rayats, to steel the latter’s hearts and by their very presence to protect
them from the tyranny of the amlas, etc. The volunteers will be
expected to remain in the villages for at least six months.
Their work will be smooth, if the Government approve of their

pre-sence; it will be risky if they do not. It is to be done in any event.
Whilst they are in the villages, they will teach the village boys and girls
and will give the rayats lessons in elementary sanitation. It may be
stated that the rayat are the most backward and ignorant of almost any
in India. Education is admittedly in the lowest stage in this dis-trict.
Sanitation is of the worst type. Children are ill-looking because they
are ill fed. The adult population suffers from some disease or other.
Many suffer from an ugly growth on the throat called goitre. They
have no physical or moral stamina. Even the Rajputs are seized with a
fear which it is humiliating to observe. The present volunteers are
pledged to the work above sketched. It is not expected that Bihar will
contribute many more volunteers of the type required. The greatest
care is being exercised in choosing them. They have to be learned,
responsible and sober men. Those who will receive these notes are
expected kindly to use their influence in securing volunteers and
getting them to send their names. At least a hundred such volunteers
are required. Those who need support for their families will have it
given them, so far as it is on a moderate scale.

DEAR MILLIE,

I have just received your letter. Matheran is not habitable in the
month of June. And Bombay is likely to suit Ceilia best then. If you
are not living with the Petits, a flat in Colaba will give you a splendid
breeze.
It is difficult for me to believe that Henry can be so bad as you
have described him. It is indeed a great relief that he is where he
receives a brotherly attention and has best possible medical advice. I
shall anxiously await a daily bulletin from you. If you do not give me
a letter, give me only p.c. please.
Is Waldo alright now? How do you find the weather there? Does
the doctor say that both Henry and Waldo will be entirely free from
the poison? You know what the doctors generally say. They say that
once the poison has entered the system, it does not leave it for years.
Of course I do not believe it and Henry’s body being so pure cannot
be so shattered as to be liable to a recurrence of the attack. However,
the greatest care has to be used during convalescence if complete cure
is to be attained.
Is Leon keeping well?
With love to you both,
Yours,

The correspondence speaks for itself. It only remains for me to
add that, so far as I am aware, there is not the slightest connection

that a portion only of the outworks has been affected by the fire.

Dear Mr. Gandhi,
Your letter of 14th May, 1917. I am able to give you the following
information. Olaha factory is an outwork of the Tarkalia concern. The buildings burnt
down were the engine room, press house and cake house. The value of the buildings
has been roughly estimated at twenty thousand rupees but this is only a very rough
estimate. No manager or Assistant Manager is in residence at the outwork. There are,
however, factory servants to look after the buildings. The outwork is situated about
twenty miles south-west of Motihari. The fact that the buildings were burnt down
shortly after you came to the district and that your visit of enquiry has caused
considerable excitement, etc., may possibly account for the rumours of all kinds
which you say have come before you.

responsibility for winding the bobbins. Let them bring along their
children. If any poor people send their children to learn, these should
be paid. We may engage them in work only for some time; during the
rest of the time we should teach them. In short, I feel it is necessary
that we should start a workshop. By and by, we shall see our way. In
this connection, I also think sometimes that, if we can get some honest,
paid men, it would be advisable to engage them. They can be set to
domestic chores and those [of us] who are at present occupied with
this work can be released. I think of this again and again. But the idea
will have to be carefully weighed. It will perhaps be convenient, for
our purpose, to engage an elderly widow, if we know of any. I keep
thinking along these lines during moments of leisure; however, since I
think of these things so far away from you, you need not attach much
weight to them. If you carry them out, it will be on your own
responsibility. Seek all possible help from Vrajlal on this question. He
will be especially in a position to say something about it since the
responsibility is his.

writing to Chhaganlal straightaway to pay you Rs. 75 a month. It
would be a great thing if you can live in such a way as to be able to
carry on without needing more. You will have to exercise enough
self-control even to do so. I see that the time has not come yet when
we have people who will manage without money or with the
barest minimum of it. For that a change in the entire atmosphere in
every family is necessary. This criticism is especially applicable to

Gujarat.
I doubt whether you will be able to bear the combined burden
of your teaching work and translating Gokhale’s speeches. My ideas
about education are very exacting. If we want to pour our souls into
the pupils, we should constantly exercise our mind on how to teach
them. We should not get angry with them. Passing on to them in the
best possible language from day to day whatever we wish to give them,
will take up much of our time. Moreover, we must for the present
think of teaching methods as well. Everything will have to be taught in
a new way. All the same, you have no option now but to finish the
translations. I say this only to point out your future responsibilities
and those of all other teachers.
I have not treated Geography as a separate subject. That is why I
have said that those who teach History should also teach Geography.
However, if you think that they should be treated as separate subjects
for the time being, you may do so. We will make what changes we
find on experience to be necessary.
The teachers will have to come together at least once a week to
exchange ideas and make such changes as may be called for. The
intelligent students should be consulted and their suggestions invited
about methods of teaching.
The students’ health is the collective responsibility of the
teachers; the main responsibility, however, will rest on the teacher in
charge of hygiene.
The teachers should read up the subjects in the curriculum
which they do not know. Especially Hindi. I can see from my work
here how very essential Hindi is. I find that I shall have to ask for
volunteers from other places. Difficulties will arise about those of
them who do not know Hindi. I see it proved every day that education
is altogether incomplete without Hindi.
It would be good, I think, if Anandshankarbhai or Keshavlalbhai1 could spare one hour daily or a few hours every week so that the
teachers’ Gujarati may attain a really high standard and they may
follow old Gujarati books without any difficulty. We may consider in
this hour what progress we can at present make in Gujarati, which
books should be considered good and what equivalents for unfamiliar

[English] words should be adopted. We can enter deep into Akha’s 1
or other serious works and resolve the difficulties which the teachers
experience from day to day in explaining certain things. These pillars
of the Gujarati language will also be better enlightened in this way and
have occasion to think about some matters to which they have given
no thought. The teachers’ technical vocabulary will become uniform
and points about spelling, etc., will be settled. At present, each of us
has his own rules, or has no rules at all, to go by.
No doubt you will show this to the other teachers as well.

BETTIAH,

DEAR MILLIE,

Your description of Henry still sounds unbelievable. The mind
simply refuses to think that he can be so pulled down. I shall still
retain my faith in the vitality of his system and believe that he will
quickly regain his original strength.
My heart goes out to poor Waldo. It must be terrible for him to
be without a companion.
I like Dr. Sapru’s advice which does not apply to Henry at all.
He has never dreamt impossible dreams, he has always settled down
like a respectable man as a conscientious man can feel settled in this
unsettled world and he has always been a practical man of affairs and
as such won esteem. His life up to the present is unimpeachable
evidence of all this. I have found that most people here and elsewhere
are highly unpractical, and falsely believing themselves to be matterof-fact men, render themselves incapable of dreaming dreams
impossible or otherwise and therefore remain totally dry as dust.
Good dreams are to the soul what fresh air is to the body.
I am pushing forward. Hundreds of men are being examined

DEAR MR. HOLTTUM ,

I thank you for having come to Sariswa 3 and having sent your
carriage.
After you and Mr. Lewis had withdrawn, I sat with the people
who must have numbered over 500 and talked to them. I told them
that you wanted to do justice, that you were ready to take back the
zirat4 lands and that you considered that it was more profitable to you
to get it back. I told them too that in your opinion the people had
taken the zirat lands from your predecessor not only willingly but
most eagerly, that it was given to the raiyats not in lieu of indigo
cultivation but it was given in order to relieve the raiyats from liability
to supply labour to the landlord. I further told them that you had
shown me Mr. Barclay’s5 letter to Mr. Gourlay 6 confirming the view
and finally told them, whilst on this point, that if they returned the

zirat lands, you expected them to grow indigo again as before up to
the termination of the period of their contracts and I assured them that
I would plead with you that it would be quite unfair to ask for raiyats
to revert to indigo-growing (for reasons to be presently stated). I then
invited those who wanted to abandon the zirat at once, although they
had paid for the full agricultural year. As a result, over 175 gave in
their names there and then and men have been streaming in during
the two days. The total has reached nearly 500 up to the time of
writing.
In going through the khatians1 , the receipts and the amounts
charged against the zirat land, I find in 70 tenancies that on an
average the raiyats are paying you Rs. 24.5.3 per bigha 2 of zirat land.
The largest amount charged is Rs. 91.7.3 per bigha and the smallest is
Rs. 7.8.0 per bigha. Incidentally, I observe that whilst 27 bighas of
kasht 3 land pay Rs. 59.13.6, 27 bighas of zirat land pay you Rs.
659.7.0. It seems that in the vast majority of cases, the raiyats hold
less than one bigha of zirat land. The rate fixed varies with the extent
of their kasht holding and not with the quality of the zirat. And they
are paying as much as Rs. 1-8-0 per bigha of kasht land in addition to
from six annas to 12 annas per katha4 of zirat. And the kathas of zirat
seem to vary with the bighas of kasht and in no case amounting to
more than 3 kathas per bigha. The average worked out for fifty
villagers comes to 1_ kathas per bigha. This, in my opinion, hardly
bears out Mr. Barclay’s contention. It rather bears out the raiyats’
contention that the settlement of zirat is another form of the tinkathia
and was designed to cover the losses suffered by the concern when the
price of indigo fell. The raiyats insist that pressure was effectively put
upon them to take zirat land. Their contention seems to be borne out
by the readiness with which they have come forward to surrender it.
For the last ten years, the raiyats have been paying what according to
the above view amounts to tawan for not growing indigo. And the
concern has on that account an average of more than Rs. 100 per
bigha of tinkathia. In the circumstances and regard being had to the
fact that you believe it to be advantageous for you to receive back the
zirat land, I hope you will not press for reversion to indigo-growing.

I notice that in some cases damages have been settled on kathas
taken out of the kasht land of the raiyats. I venture to think that, if
you would see your way to accept my suggestion, take back the zirat
and forgo the future damage whether tacked on to the zirat or to the
kasht land, one of the sorest points of dispute between the concern
and the raiyats would be amicably settled and you will have set an
example which would be advantageously followed by the other
planters.
In describing the process adopted by the concern for recovering
losses on indigo from the raiyats, I have hitherto confined myself to
your mukarrari land. On tikka land, you seem to have accepted the
system followed elsewhere. You have taken handnotes for balance of
tawan payable by the raiyats bearing heavy rate of interest. I suggest
that the outstanding handnotes may be cancelled. The raiyats for the
sake of peace and compromise should say nothing as to refund either
on the hunda above referred to or the tawan already collected and of
which the handnotes represent the balance.
As to the fines, I must confess that there is overwhelming
evidence to show that they have been imposed on recalcitrant raiyats.
This complaint is almost universal. I told the raiyats that you said that
only nominal fines were imposed when the raiyats came to you for
adjustment of their mutual quarrels and that you refunded these to the
winners. The raiyats resolutely protested and said that the fines even
as much as Rs. 25 at a time and more were imposed for the so-called
offences against the concern.
The raiyats are equally firm in their complaint against your
jamadar, Gokul Missir, and I would be pleased to place the evidence
before you if you will care to go further into the matter.
With reference to the method (I understand only recently
adopted) of the charging for permission to build new buildings or to
rebuild, you justified the charge on the ground that the earth on the
raiyats’ tenement belonged to the landlord and if the raiyats used it
for building purposes, they must pay for it. I find, on looking up the
Bengal Tenancy Act, that the law allows the raiyats to build without
any interference from the landlord so long as they build for the
benefit of their holdings. It seems to me that the charge is not
warranted by law and I hope that you will waive it in future.
There remains then the question of cutting trees. The section of
the Bengal Tenancy Act dealing with the subject clearly allows the
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

385

raiyat to cut without previous notice to or permission of the landlord.
But I understand that of late years the landlords have all over been
receiving half of the timber cut. I do not know whether the custom has
been proved; this is a large question which can await settlement.
I await papers promised by you regarding Kodai Pan. As to
Sitaram Tewari 1 , I think Rs. 36 on 11 kathas is a clerical error and I
venture to suggest that it would be graceful on your part to recognize
the error and take the rent at the usual assessment rate.
I would beg of you to carefully consider the points mentioned
herein and, if you can grant relief to your raiyats in accordance with
the suggestions made above, I do not doubt that it will lead to a lasting
peace between your concern and its raiyats and, what is more, it will
be a simple act of justice.
I am,
Yours truly,

315. LETTER TO W. B. HEYCOCK
BETTIAH,

May 20, 1917
DEAR MR. HEYCOCK,

I have hitherto refrained from bringing to your notice
statements, which have continued to stream in, to the effect that the
raiyats are being prevented from coming in to me and that those who
have come in have been subjected to all kinds of pinpricks by the
kothi amlas and in some cases by the managers themselves. I have
discounted some of the statements. I have taken down a few. But if
what I have heard about the doings of the Belwa and the Dhokraha
concerns is true, it is calculated to end on one side at least, the friendly
spirit in which the inquiry has hitherto been carried on. I am most
anxious to continue and to increase the friendly spirit. I am straining
every [nerve], so far as in me lies, to so conduct my mission that
nothing but good-will should be left behind, when its labours are
finished. I send you the statements1 taken regarding the Belwa and the
Dhokraha concerns. If the statements are true, they do not reflect any
credit upon the concerns in question. I enclose, too, my letter2 to Mr.
Holttum which was written before I heard of the fire and which was
despatched before I took the statements of the Dhokraha men last
evening after 6.30 P.M.
I can understand and even appreciate the feelings which are
bound to fill those who are called upon to contemplate the prospect of
having to forego huge incomes which they have hitherto been in the
habit for a long time of receiving from their raiyats. One cannot,
therefore, mind any legitimate effort on their part to hold on to what
they have considered as their rights. But what is reported to have
happened at the Belwa and Dhokraha dehats does not in my opinion
fall under such a category.

It is a known fact that the desire of the planters generally is, that
my friends and I should not carry on our work. I can only say that
nothing but physical force from the Government or an absolute
guarantee that the admitted or provable wrongs of the raiyats are
to stop for ever, can possibly remove us from the District. What
I have seen of the conditions of the raiyats is sufficient to convince
me that if we withdrew at this stage, we would stand condemned before
man and God and, what is most important of all, we would never be
able to forgive ourselves.
But the mission is totally of peace. I cannot too often give the
assurance that I bear no ill-will against the planters. I have been told
that this is true of myself but that my friends are fired with an
anti-English feeling and that for them this is an anti-English
movement. I can only say that I do not know a body of men who have
less of that feeling than my friends. I was not prepared for this
pleasant revelation. I was prepared for some degree of ill-will. I would
have held it excusable. I do not know that I have not been guilty of it
myself under circumstances which have appeared to me most
provoking. But if I found that any of my associates were, in the
conduct of this mission, actuated by any ill-will at all, I should
disassociate myself entirely from them and insist upon their leaving
the mission. At the same time, the determination to secure a freedom
for the raiyats from the yoke that is wearing them down is inflexible.
Cannot the Government secure that freedom? This is a natural
exclamation. My answer is that they cannot, in cases like this, without
such assistance as is afforded to them by my mission. The
Government machinery is designedly slow. It moves, must move,
along the line of least resistance. Reformers like myself, who have no
other axe to grind but that of reform they are handling for the time
being, specialize and create a force which the Government must
reckon with. Reformers may go wrong by being overzealous,
indiscreet or indolent and ignorant. The Government may go wrong
by being impatient of them or over-confident of their ability to do
without them. I hope, in this case, neither catastrophe will take place
and the grievances, which I have already submitted and which are
mostly admitted, will be effectively redressed. Then the planters will
have no cause to fear or suspect the mission of which I have the
honour to be in charge and they will gladly accept the assistance of
volunteers who will carry on the work of education and sanitation
among the villagers and act as links between them and the raiyats.

Pray, excuse the length of this letter as also its argumentative
character. I could not avoid it, if I was to place my true position
before you. In bringing the two matters which have necessitated this
communication, I have no desire to seek legal relief. But I ask you to
use such administrative influence as you can to preserve the friendly
spirit which has hitherto prevailed between the kothis and my friends
and myself.
I do not wish to suggest that the kothis in question are
responsible for the fire. That is the suspicion of some of the raiyats. I
have talked to hundreds of them about the two fires. They say that the
raiyats are not responsible for them, that they have no connection with
the mission. I readily accept this repudiation because we are
incessantly telling the raiyats that this is not a mission of violence or
reprisals and that any such thing on their part can only delay relief.
But if the kothis may not be held responsible for them, they may not
seek to establish a connection between them and the mission. Fires
have taken place before now, and, mission or no mission, they will
take place for ever. Neither party may blame the other without the
clearest possible proofs.
There is talk, too, about the lives of the planters being in danger.
Surely this cannot be serious talk. Anyway, the mission cannot render
them less safe than they are. The character of the mission is wholly
against any such activity. It is designed to seek relief by self-suffering,
never by doing violence to the supposed or real wrongdoer. And this
lesson has been inculcated among the raiyats in season and out of
season.Lastly, there is, I fear, ample proof of intimidation such as is
described in the statements thereto attached. Intimidation can only
mean more trouble all round without meaning the slightest relief to
the planters in the shape of retention of the present system.
I seek such help as you can vouchsafe in the circumstances I
have ventured to place before you.
I am sending a copy to Mr. Lewis.

I have been waiting for your letter since you reached Rajkot.
Hope respected Khushalbhai is well. Doctor writes to say that you
have not yet received article No. 3. How can that be? All the articles
should be there only. Mr. Polak has nothing with him. He has gone
through all the articles. Hope they are not mixed up. You would have
given article No. 2 to the press for printing. You would have received
the article published in Madras. It is good if a Gujarati write-up on it
appears in Prajabhandhu and Gujarati Panch. Entrust this work to
Dr. Hariprasad. Send the copy of the booklet to all the libraries. You
can get the list from Akhandanandji. For more addresses, get the
Times of India directory from the G.V.S.2 and look for the name of
newspapers in that. Make a list of the names where you have sent the
booklet and send that to Doctor. Finish the work soon.
You must have seen in my article about this place what 1 have
written on volunteers. It is necessary to keep a list of all those who are
prepared to come. They should arrive within minutes of receiving
intimation.

317. NOTES ON THE SITUATION IN CHAMPARAN-III
(Dated Bettiah, the 20th May 1917)
BETTIAH,

May 211 , 1917
CONFIDENTIAL

This is the 3rd note on the situation in Champaran.
The planters are, it is evident, trying to quash the mission or to
discredit it.
The first remedy to secure their end was to tell the Government
that their lives were in danger, owing to the presence of the mission in
Champaran, and to suggest that there should be a commission
appointed to investigate the relations between the planters and rayats.
Their lives are no more in danger now than they were before.
The rayats are too docile, and too much cowed down to attempt any
such thing even if they wished it; moreover, the creed of the mission is
absence of violence under every conceivable circumstance.
Mr. Gandhi himself, in his letter2 to the Viceroy, written just after
his arrival, suggested a commission, when he was about to be
imprisoned. But in the light of the discoveries since made, any
commission can only delay relief. And the leaders, after knowing the
situation as it is partly disclosed in the representation to the
Government already sent to them, cannot contemplate the possibility
of the grievances continuing for an indefinite time. Most of the
serious grievances are admitted. They have not disappeared because
the Government have been supine. They have been afraid to apply the
remedies with firmness. They have placed too much reliance upon the
good faith of the planters. And the planters have disregarded both the
laws and the Government instructions. No commission can deal with
such a situation. The Government alone can do it, if they wish or are
forced. It is clear that the planters want a commission, which would
supplant and extinguish the activities of the mission. The workers in
the cause cannot, without doing the greatest violence to their
conscience, retire in favour of a commission. The appointment of the
1

Gandhiji appears to have begun this note on the 20th and to have concluded
it on the 21st.

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

391

commission can, therefore, be accepted only if the continuing wrongs
are remedied now, and if the members appointed on the commission
are such as to inspire confidence, and this on the understanding that
the mission is to continue its work. The scope of it will be changed if a
commission is appointed, i.e., the mission instead of conducting the
enquiry will be collecting evidence to be placed before the
commission, and taking the villagers’ statements. The wrongs that
must be redressed before a commission is accepted are (i) the
abolition, not in name but in reality, of abwabs or illegal cesses
exacted by the planters, (ii) the abolition of the damages in lieu of the
indigo cultivations whether in a lump sum or by way of sharahbeshi,
(iii) the abolition of tinkanthia in every shape or form, (iv) the
abolition of the custom of imposing fines on raiyats, (v) the abolition
of force in exacting labour or other obedience to the planters’ will.
What, therefore, the commission will enquire into will be: (l) the
condition of the tenure of planters; (2) the propriety and possibility of
securing for the rayats a refund of the illegal cesses already taken by
the planters; (3) the condition under which labour has been received
by the landlords; (4) the sufficiency or otherwise of the wages
received by the labourers; (5) the causes of the deep poverty of the
masses and their utter helplessness.
The above points have merely to be mentioned to know that the
planters contemplate a commission totally different from the one we
should accept.
The safest plan, therefore, for the Press and the public, in so far
as it may be necessary to give an opinion, is to insist on the redress of
the admitted wrongs first, and then accept appointment of a
commission, if found necessary, it being always understood that the
workers continue their work, in any event.
The second method adopted by the planters is to seize or create
incidents in order to make the Government nervous about the mission
and to intimidate the mission and its helpers.
One fire1 has already been so used. The popular belief is that the
damage done is slight and that it is the work of the planters
themselves. But that idea may be dismissed. The fire may be accepted
as an accident or the act of an incendiary, not in any way connected
1

392

At the Olaha factory
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

with the mission. Mr. Heycock’s letter 1 , in answer to Mr. Gandhi’s
question2 , shows that (1) the damage done is at the mostRs. 20,000; he
himself emphasises the fact that it is a rough estimate, i.e., given by the
planters; (2) he has no evidence that there is the slightest connection
between the enquiry and the fire.
To this may be added the fact that no member of the mission
has gone to these parts, and that the outwork was not in use, when the
fire broke out. Another fire3 broke out on the 19th instant. A katcheri 4
has been burnt down. It is not known whether it has been utilised by
the planters for the end suggested above. That fire did take place in a
place just newly visited by the mission. Mr. Gandhi went there on
Wednesday and the fire broke out, on Friday last. Immediately on the
outbreak of the fire, information was brought to Mr. Gandhi that it
was probably the work of the kothi people. A statement 5 has been
recorded to the effect that a factory man was seen the very evening
removing a bundle of papers—the inference being that the papers
were removed prior to setting the katcheri on fire. Support is lent to
the story from the fact that the manager and the Sub-Divisional
Officer were present at the enquiry for a short time on Wednesday,
that the rayats mentioned—firmly that they were forcibly made to
take zirat land, which was made to bear the losses which the concern
suffered owing to the fall in the price of indigo, that the manager in
bravado said that he would gladly take the zirat back, that Mr. Gandhi
promptly invited the names of those who wanted to surrender the zirat
land. This mishap (to the concern) must have (so the theory runs)
enraged the manager, and in order to discredit the enquiry, he must
have instigated the fire. On Thursday, the day previous to the fire, the
manager went to a neighbouring village, and spoke roughly to the
people, inasmuch as they had surrendered their zirat, and threatened
them by saying he would insist on their re-growing indigo. The rayats
remained unmoved. This would be an additional reason for starting
the fire. This, however, is purely an impression which may have no
foundation in facts. One thing is certain that the mission has

absolutely nothing to do with the fires. The value of the katcheri is
unknown. It is not likely to be more than Rs. 200.1
The third method adopted is continuous pinpricks administered
to the villagers. The latest instance of organised intimidation is where
factory amlas went to a village, and molested the labourers of a small
zamindar, who is a co-sharer in a small zamindari with the factory, and
who declines to surrender his share to it, and who is alleged to have
circulated among the rayats the news of the mission. Statements have
been received abundantly proving the alleged intimidation. Reports
are continuously being received from individual rayats to the effect
that they are threatened with all kinds of penalties for going to Mr.
Gandhi and they come at considerable risk to themselves.
Needless to say that nothing will deter the workers from
continuing their work. To abandon it would mean a terrible wrong
done to the rayats. The presence of a body of workers, always
listening to the simple but pathetic tale of their woes, and the
knowledge that they are striving to help them and that the latter would
go to them in the hour of need have buoyed them up and have given
them hope and courage. The workers will be unworthy of their cause
and country, if through fear or anything else, they for a moment
thought of withdrawing until the rayats are able to breathe free.
Mr. Gandhi has addressed to the District Magistrate of
Champaran a letter2 on the incidents above set forth. Copies of this
letter and other documents will be sent herewith or will shortly follow.
The precautions thus taken may restrain the planters in their plan of
intimidation. But the situation may develop at any moment and
lawlessness may break out in intense form. It will now be understood
that if this happens, the fault will in no way be that of the members of
the mission, and that the public will understand that the mission will
continue its work.
The foregoing emphasises the need for getting volunteers ready,
so that they may start at a moment’s notice. The volunteers must be
grown up, responsible, sober and educated men. They should be
inured to hardships or ready to bear hardships; they should come
prepared to see the struggle through, they must have workable
knowledge of Hindi (Tamils alone are, therefore, ineligible, unless

villages and live in the midst of the rayats. It is estimated that they will
have to work for at least 6 months.

MY DEAR MILLIE,

I see that as your labours are about to finish (thank God) the
heat is beginning to tell on you. It is ever thus. Somehow or other
Providence is the kindest when it puts us through the sorest trials.
Please tell Henry he ought to have sent me the speeches to which he
has written his eloquent preface. But if the preface is eloquent it is not
written from the depth of his heart. If he had, he would have shown
the sham underlying it all without wounding anybody. The preface
leaves on one the impression that there was no other side to the
picture. And yet it obtrudes itself on one wherever we go. So, I shall
charitably assume that Henry thought he might for once at least leave
it alone.
With love,

DEAR MR. HEYCOCK,

I send herewith a further statement about Dhokraha fire which
speaks for itself.
Yours truly,

M. K. GANDHI
[ENCLOSURE]
BETTIAH ,

The 21st May, 1917
This morning at about 10 a.m. some men came from Dhokraha and informed
Mr. Gandhi that some officers had been there. He was questioning them on the
occurrence, when one of them said that he had heard that the doors of the kachahri had
been removed by the factory men before the fire. I suggested that a local inspection
might give us useful information. Mr. Gandhi accepted the suggestion and asked me
to go to Dhokraha personally. Accordingly, I proceeded to the scene at once.I reached
Dhokraha at about 11.30 a.m. In the kothi I found only a cartman. He denied having
been present during the time the fire was raging and informed me that the chaukidar 1
was. I asked him to fetch the chaukidar. Meanwhile I proceeded to inspect the
kachahri.
This kachahri is situated inside the compound of the residential bungalow of
the manager of the concern. It consists of a single room about 21 feet by 15 feet
roughly. . . .
The entire roof work has come down. The walls are made of
bricks, plastered with mud. The whitewash on the walls, both inside and outside,
is unaffected. Black was noticeable at the top at four or five places only.
The appearance of the upper portion of the wall gives one the impression that
the rafter of the roof must have been pulled away to prevent the spreading of the
fire. The roof was thatched with straw over which was placed a covering of country
tiles. . . .At places in the heap of rubbish were noticeable charred rafters, both outside
and inside the room. There was found a heap of partly burnt papers.
I examined them. They were all siahas 2 and sattas. The siahas were for the

year 1313 Fasli and the year 1315 Fasli1 . None of these were completely destroyed. ( )
. . .The doors as well as the frames of the three windows were altogether untouched by
fire. The door C was not found in the buildings, nor was its framework there. This
door is about 7_ feet by 5 feet. There were clear indications of the framework of the
door being removed. The plaster had given way. The mud underneath the framework
was quite clean. At the door D, the framework was charred all along, but not damaged
much. There were a few hinges sticking to it. I examined them and the fresh removal
of the rust from them clearly suggested that the screws had been taken out of them.
One or two screws were found still in the holes. The door appertaining to this
framework was not there. There were no indications in the debris of the frame or the
door in their burnt condition. No panes were found at C. There were about half a dozen
small pieces of glass.
This room is said to have been formerly used as an office where rent was
collected. About 2 or 3 years back, it was stated, this office was closed and all the
papers of the concern were removed to Loheria. Only a chaukidar remains in this
compound. A house about a hundred yards away from the residential bungalow is
occupied by the kothi men.
The examination of the debris showed that the contents of the room when the
fire broke out could only have been meagre. I estimate the damage to be under Rs.
200.

BETTIAH,

CHI. CHHAGANLAL,

This letter is only for you two brothers2 . We must not turn away
from the temper of the times. Whatever your parents may say, deep
down they do wish that their devoted son and their daughter-in-law
should be with them. One of you two brothers should certainly stay
with them. If they are unwilling to come to Ahmedabad you should

go to Rajkot. If the times were not awry why would families break up?
Hence, I am convinced that if Khushalbhai does not come to
Ahmedabad, one of you brothers must stay at Rajkot.
We assume that there is nothing wrong in our women going to
their in-laws or their parents for delivery. This too I think is not right.
Why should Narandas send Jamna to Rajkot? Why can’t you see that
if the delivery cannot take place in Bombay, it is not a fit place to live
in? Who will see Jamna through her delivery? Had Dev Bhabhi1 not
been an invalid it would have been simple. Now she cannot be
expected to attend to such jobs. It is our duty to make our parents feel
in their old age that it is not only we who are their children but that
they are the progenitors of the world at large. This can happen only
when we do not make them slave for us. It is the duty of a husband to
be with his wife during child-birth. (This last is a separate idea but I
am mentioning it here.)
Why is Santok at Morvi? I am troubled by the information. Her
duty solely was to serve the sick at Rajkot. She should not have left the
house at Rajkot even for a single moment. That is my view. I realize
that if Santok does not feel so she cannot be forced to do it. I am
writing this for consideration of the matter to the extent that Maganlal
has sympathy with it. Maganlal too is one of us. All that he can say is:
‘this is worth doing and this is not.’ He cannot go beyond that. It
occurs to me that I should put before you two the question whether
our education has in some way harmed the purity of filial devotion.
If you think it proper let Narandas read this letter. My mind is
otherwise occupied and right now I have some other work to attend to.
Hence, I have not found the peace of mind that is requisite for writing
this letter. Usually I have peace at this time. It is just six o’clock in the
morning. I am hesitating for fear that Narandas may not realize the
import of my writing. You two know me quite well and so I do not
hesitate to put my jumbled ideas before you. Jamnadas may read this
letter.

I have your postcard. If the Bhadla property goes, 1 shall blame
you alone. You ought to have taken immediate steps. I sent you the
reply which had been received. Why did you not apply right then?
You should now give the enclosed letter to Behcharbhai. Take him
with you and submit an application to the proper authority.
As for the expenses on the looms which you ask for, write to
Chi. Maganlal. He will send what he thinks fit. You don’t say what
progress you have made. I don’t know whether you devote all your
time to your work. You are growing more proficient in weaving day
by day; you should both devote yourselves entirely to that work. Then
alone will-you succeed.
You may, if so inclined, send Chi. Chhotam to Ahmedabad.
Send him only if he is agreeable. It is necessary to win him over.
Don’t force him to go. It is because he was very eager to go with you
that I allowed him. He will get along in Ahmedabad only if he is
himself willing.
I shall never approve of your going to South Africa. I see
nothing but harm in your submitting to Ratanshi’s 2 desire in this
matter. He keeps on writing but so far he has not sent a single pie. If
you go there, I think your life will be wasted as his has been. If you
wish, you may send this letter to Ratanshi.
I think weaving has a bright future, if only you two devote
yourselves to it.

Lakhan Rai and Kawaldhari, both raiyats of Baratola village

removed by your men on Sunday and Monday last, and that the
removal took place in your presence. They further state that this was
done as a punishment for their having come previously and made

I am suggesting that [as] the matters complained of by me
required immediate treatment, it was not contemplated that the
Government could pass orders without receiving reports from the
local officers and without hearing the landlords. Had I intended
otherwise, the sending of copies of my note1 to the local officers and
the Planters’ Associations would have been purposeless. If I may be
permitted to say so, the instructions to the local officers and the
invitation to the Planters’ Associations to send in their reports or
observations, as the case may be, before the 30th June next largely
meets the situation in point of time.
With reference to the legal aspect and the decisions of courts,
they have not escaped attention. But I venture to submit that legal
decisions or legal technicalities cannot for a moment be allowed to
perpetuate wrongs suffered by vast masses of people. With much
respect, but every confidence, I submit that the situation presented by
me raises grave moral issues which in order that justice may be done
might necessitate disregard of legal technicalities and legal decisions
where they are in conflict with real justice. The vast inequality between
landlords and rayats renders it well-nigh impossible for courts of law
or even Settlement Officers to arrive at the truth in cases brought
before them. I see illustrations of the proposition just submitted
multiplying before me every day. Instances are not wanting of wrongs
having been rectified in spite of their having been countenanced by
courts of justice.
Regarding abwabs, I may be permitted to point out that the
inclusion of a penalty clause in the forthcoming Bettiah Raj leases will
grant only partial and tardy relief. For the leases will not cover the
whole of the tenancies affected, and with respect to a wrong which has
been unanimously admitted, the postponement of relief till the
termination of and the renewal of the leases means unnecessary delay.
I take it that the leases will not be renewed until the agrarian condition
is placed on a sound basis. It may be added that a penalty clause in his
lease is no remedy against a landlord who places himself above law. In
my humble opinion, therefore, the issue of a notice warning landlords
against exacting abwabs, salami 2 , fines, etc., or impressing labour,
carts, or ploughs and informing raiyats that they ought not to pay
them and that they are not bound to give their landlords their labour

desire to grant them speedy relief where relief is deemed necessary.

MOTIHARI,

DEAR MR. HEYCOCK,

I have just now before me men from Ramsingh Chhatauni who
tell me that they were beaten by Mr. Irwin on Sunday night. They say
there are men too who saw an assault committed on a third man and
themselves by the factory men.
Another man tells me that over fifty bighas of their own land
was taken away from them by the kothi in exchange for some other
land for which they did not then care and do not now care.If these
statements are true, they are serious. As there appears to be some
tension, I want as far as is possible to avoid for
a little time having to go to the dehats. But I feel however that I
should visit Chhatauni this evening. And I shall leave here at 5.30
p.m. precisely unless you desire me to adopt any other
course.1

MY DEAR ESTHER,

Your letter is so good that I am taking the liberty of sending it to
the Polaks to read and then forward it to Ahmedabad. I hope you,
don’t mind my having taken the liberty.
Those who do not grow indigo, also want to make illegal gains.
Hence they force the raiyats on their land to labour for them at a
trifling wage or none at all at times and make them pay extras
apart from rents. Yes, the condition is no better than that of slaves. The
further papers I have sent you will throw more light on the question. I
must say that the planters are not alone to blame. The planters happen
to be English. Indian landlords are not better and some of them are
much worse. It is undoubtedly the ignorance on this point of public
men that has permitted the wrong to continue so long. Governments
rarely move except under pressure.

MY DEAR MILLIE,

This illness of Henry’s must have been the greatest trial of his

providence. Nala is said to have been bitten by a cobra. The cobra
when asked by Nala, told him that he was bitten so as to transform his
appearance and so enable him successfully to hide his identity during
his banishment.2 I do believe that our illnesses often comes to us as
disciplinary measures.
After a long silence I received a letter from Natesan 3 today in
which he says that he has been away in Ooty, etc. This may account
for his silence. But he is, I know, very careless about answering letters.
I am not excusing him. I am describing his limitations.

332. SPREADING HINDI1
Hindi alone can become the common language of the educated
people of India. All that has to be considered is how this can be
brought about. The place that English is trying to usurp today, and
which it is impossible for it to take, must be given to Hindi; for it
alone has the right to it. This place cannot go to English, for it is a
foreign language and very difficult for us to learn. Learning Hindi is
child’s play in comparison. The number of those speaking Hindi is
almost 65 million. The Bengali, Bihari, Oriya, Marathi, Gujarati,
Rajasthani, Punjabi and Sindhi languages are sisters of Hindi. People
speaking these languages can understand and speak a little of Hindi.
If we include these, the number is almost 220 million. How then can
English, which even a hundred thousand Indians cannot speak
correctly, compete successfully with a language which is so widely
used? That to this day we have not even begun conducting our
national business in Hindi is because of our cowardice, lack of faith
and ignorance of the greatness of the Hindi language. If we give up
our cowardice, cultivate faith and realize the greatness of the Hindi
language, Hindi will begin to be used for the work of our national and
Provincial councils and Government or-ganizations. The beginning
should be made in the Provinces. If there is some difficulty in this, it is
for people speaking the Dravidian languages like Tamil, etc., but we
have the remedy for this too. Hindi-knowing men who are zealous,
brave, full of self-respect and energetic should be sent to Madras and
other provinces to teach Hindi without receiving payment. With the
help of such heroic missionaries, the educated people of Madras, etc.
can learn Hindi in a very short time. If we have the right spirit, the
solution is as simple as the rule of three.
The more instructors are sent, the faster will be the spread of
Hindi. Besides the sending of teachers, self-instruction books should
also be prepared. These books should be distributed free. Famous
speakers should also be sent to bring home to the people the
importance of learning Hindi.
What it is necessary to do in Tamil Nad for the spread of Hindi,
it is desirable to do in Bombay and other provinces. Hindi books
should be prepared for people speaking Marathi, Gujarati, etc., and
1

workers should be sent to those areas.
This work requires money. The well-to-do among us should not
take it as a burden. It is their duty to assist in this gigantic enterprise.
It is necessary to set up a small committee to organize this. It will be
proper to see that only active workers are put on it.
One important matter is implied in this submission and that is
that no distinction is made between Hindi and Urdu. Indeed, why
should we quarrel with our Muslim brethren? They may use the
Persian script. A few among us know the Persian script and more will
learn it. So long as our Muslim brethren have not learnt the
Devnagari, both the scripts will continue to be used for national work.
However, this is a matter we can decide in a fraternal spirit with our
Muslim brethren. Right now the chief task is to spread the national
language throughout India in the Devnagari script.

If the continuing known wrongs are immediately redressed, any

likely to meet the existing situation. The work of my colleagues and
myself will then for the time being mostly consist in marshalling

BETTIAH,

May 30, 1917
DEAR SIR,

Owing to certain statements made by your raiyats of Tola
Gujpura Ramsingh, Chhatauni, I paid on Friday last a surprise visit to
the Tola at about 8 p.m.
I met over fifty villagers and they pointed out to me a piece of
land said to be 51 bighas in extent which (they said) had been
recently converted by you into zirat. They said that in most cases they
were given an equivalent in extent but not in quality. They pointed
out the village pasturage bordering on the converted zirat which (they
said) had now become practically inaccessible owing to the fear of
their cattle being impounded. They showed me also the only way
(according to their statement) leading to the cattle pound, and said
that they could not for the same fear use it as it passed by the zirat.
The men bitterly complained that the dispossession which they hold
was forcible had caused them a great loss. They stated that at the time
of conversion they were made to put their thumb impressions to
certain documents the contents of which they did not know and the
1

copies of which they were not given.
Hiraman Lohar, who was one of the party, told me that he was
assaulted on Sunday, the 20th instant, by your employees for having
remonstrated with them on their trying to take his bhusa 1 , and that he
was only released on the importunity of the villagers who intervened
on his behalf. Nepali and Japal, nephew and son, respectively, of
Hiraman, told me that as a result of the occurrence they were on their
way to me. The cry was raised that they were going to the thana. Your
men thereupon ran after them, seized them (so it is stated) and took
them to you. They added that you whipped them. One of them
showed strong marks on his calves and on his back. They were sent by
you to the murghikhana2 and were fined Rs. 10 each. They were
released at midnight on their promising to secure the fines in the
morning. For these fines a guarantee was given by Mahajan Liladhar
Sah to your representative the next morning.
Jadu Rai, of village Katha, son of Man Singh Rai, came to me at
Motihari on the 26th instant and said that he held six bighas of land,
that he had paid Rs. 75 as tawan in lieu of indigo cultivation, that for
failure to supply a plough to the factory and to pay a fine of Rs. 10 in
default he was dispossessed of his land and made to sign a document.
He showed me a receipt No. 102 dated 1323 [sic] for Rs. 14.6.9.
I feel it but right that I should bring to your notice matters of
the character above referred to. I should esteem it a favour if you
would throw light on the incidents I have described.

337. LETTER TO CHIEF SECRETARY, BIHAR
BETTIAH,

May 30, 1917
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 27th instant on the agrarian situation in Champaran.
I shall be pleased to wait on His Honour at Ranchi on Monday
next, the 4th June, at midday.
Your letter raises issues which it is impossible for me to ignore if
I am faithfully to serve the cause that keeps me in Champaran.
It is part of the raiyats’ case that the planters will stop short of
nothing to gain their end. I have noticed ever since my arrival the very
great and undue influence that the planters enjoy over everybody and
in everything. They have striven their best to have me removed from
Champaran. They have not hesitated to impute motives to the
honourable men who at considerable personal sacrifice have been
giving me valuable assistance. They have without doubt used at least
“moral suasion” in keeping the raiyats from coming to me. At
Dhokraha I witnessed the sorrowful spectacle of two or three men
declaiming, in the presence of the Manager and the Subdivisional
Officer, on the virtues of the kothi in front of a crowd of nearly 500
men who complained bitterly against the kothi about zirat
land forced-on them and fines exacted from them for disobedience.
These witnesses were brought by the Manager from Loheria to say
that Loheria had no complaint and that the Dhokraha complaints
were due to the machinations of one or two agitators. Since then
many Loheria raiyats have come and complained precisely in the
same manner as Dhokraha men. It should be noted that if full justice
is done to the raiyats, planters stand to lose huge yearly incomes and
many privileges they have hitherto enjoyed. In the circumstances, I do
not entirely discount the statement the raiyats make to me that the
fires have been instigated by the kothis in question to discredit my
mission and to remove me from their midst. The raiyats add that they
might be given some credit for selfishness and that their self-interest
should deter them from incendiarism or such other acts. I have
submitted to the District Magistrate the results of my inquiry1 into the
Dhokraha fire. I beg to enclose copy of my letter to Mr. Heycock 2 . I

am, however, willing to disbelieve the raiyats’ theory and put down the
fire to natural accidents. I may add, however, that in the Dhokraha
fire, it was the roofing alone that was burnt. But I venture to suggest
that even if it is the wilful act of a maniacal raiyat done in the
excitement caused by my presence; it would be no justification for my
removal, unless the Government are satisfied that I have been directly
or indirectly instrumental in causing the fires. Finally, there have been
fires in the kothis before my arrival and that the excitement in
Champaran as admitted by the Commissioner was in existence long
before I entered Bihar. I wish respectfully to warn the Government
that they will have utterly misunderstood the position if they remove
me from the raiyats. I have no desire to do aught except promote
peace between the planters and the raiyats so as to secure to the
raiyats the freedom and dignity that should belong to all mankind.
I ask the Government to dismiss from their minds the theory
suggested by the planters that the present excitement is caused by
mischievous persons for private reasons. Planters are too powerful to
be touched by any person, no matter how mischievous he may be.
The raiyats say that they never deserved the police guards that were
placed in their villages and that they were part of the policy of
repression pursued by the planters. It is admitted that in Sathi the
Manager was more to blame than the raiyats, and yet the raiyats had
to pay with their blood and money. It is all peace there now, because
the Manager knows his work. I have before me statements from over
7,000 raiyats from all parts of Champaran. I have seen all of them
though I have found it impossible personally to take down their
statements. It is difficult for me to believe that they all tell lies at the
instigation of a few mischievous men.
I enclose copies of my letters1 addressed to the Manager of the
Motihari concern. I have not had any reply to my first
communication. Probably there is the other side to the story, but the
incidents described show at what risk the raiyats come to me. I quote
what Mr. Johnston2 , one time Subdivisional Officer in Bettiah
Subdivision, had to say in 1914 regarding the methods adopted by
planters to bend the raiyats to their will:
There are four methods prevalent in this subdivision compelling recalcitrant
tenants to pay up. The commonest way is by putting peons on, the petitions do not

allege that this has been done. The next way is to attach crops standing on khalihan 1 ,
but this also is not alleged. Then sometimes the barbers and washermen are stopped
from rendering their services; the petitioners only fear this, it has not been done yet.
Finally, a very effective means is to impound the raiyats’ cattle either in a private
pound or if the D. B. pound is leased out to the landlord then in it.

The report itself is otherwise hostile to the raiyats. I am of
opinion that it did not do justice to the raiyats. I give this opinion in
all humility and after having thoroughly gone into the situation. It is
often forgotten that it is not necessary for the planters to resort to
force actually in every case. The fact that it is there to be used on the
slightest attempt at the show of independence is enough to prevent
recalcitrancy. I respectfully submit that planters have had it their own
way long enough [so] that the raiyats are in a condition of paralysis.
They are worthy of patient care and attention from the Government.
But the latter will not render that help, unless they are prepared to
believe the raiyats’ story (exaggerated no doubt it will be) in
preference to the planters’.
I tender my apology for the length of this communication. If I
have been over-frank, the cause I espouse must be my excuse. It is too
great to admit of tinkering. I hope that at a crisis like the one that
faces the Government and the people of India, the Government do not
wish me to conceal my feelings.
I am deeply grateful to His Honour that he has decided to have
a personal conversation with me. I shall hope for the sake of the
raiyats that nothing I may say or do will adversely affect their
cause, and that I shall find the right word in His Honour’s presence so
that he can appreciate the awfulness of the raiyats’ position even as I
do.

BETTIAH,

May 30, 1917
CONFIDENTIAL

The matters seem to be reaching a crisis as will appear from the
enclosed letter 1 from the Government and reply2 thereto. If Mr.
Gandhi and his colleagues are removed, it is expected that the leaders
will one after another step into the breach. In order to do this, it is
necessary to realize the inner situation here. It is this: raiyats are so
paralysed and have suffered so long that they had begun to believe
that deliverance was never coming. They now feel the warmth of the
proximity of their own countrymen who are at least willing to listen to
them if they can render no effective help. This has been enough to
rouse their drooping-spirits. It will be cruel to leave them unguarded
until the question is settled and their independence guaranteed to
them. Forcible removal of the mission is likely to lead to terrorism
and under it to recantation of the statements hitherto made. A further
note with the papers referred to in the reply to the Chief Secretary will
follow.

339. LETTER TO SANKALCHAND SHAH
BETTIAH,

Jeth Sud I [May 30, 1917] 1
BHAISHRI SANKALCHAND,

I happen to be free at the moment. I read your letter again, and
also the time-table2 . A time-table always gives me a headache. I have
made no attempt to remember this one.
I think history and geography, which have been mentioned as
separate subjects, should be included under Gujarati. We want to
develop the intellect through the Gujarati language. For that purpose,
we may use a language book one day and a text on history the next.
We should orally go over the matter to be taught and then make [the
students] read something on it. This will reduce the quantum of
literature by a little, but that should not matter. If the history and the
geography being taught are of the same country, the latter will be easy
to learn and prove interesting. As for history, to the extent that we
treat it as literature, we may give [the students] some well-phrased
pithy sentences. For instance, “We look upon Ramachandra as an
avatar, as God Himself. The term avatar is of Sanskrit origin. Avatru
means to descend. God’s descent (to this earth) is his avatar. But at
the moment we are not thinking of Rama as an avatar. We shall only
consider the Rama of history.” Whether these sentences have any life
in them, you teachers know best. But they are good enough to
illustrate my point. This will cover literature all right. We may
compose many such sentences as we narrate the history of
Ramachandra. We may first dictate them or write them out on the
blackboard and then tell the story. We may deliberately use some
difficult words, as we do so. The pupils will want to know their
meanings and so the discussion will proceed. Since he was born in
Ayodhya, it will be necessary to explain its geography. There will of
course be a map. How far it is from Ahmedabad, how one may arrive
there, what it is like today, whether it answers to the poet’s description
of it—all this is literature, history, and geography combined. You must

first make up your mind, while telling a story like this, how much
literature you wish to teach, how much of history and how much of
geography and then be as one with the pupils. Sanskrit should be
simplified and, if it is grouped with Marathi and the two taught on
alternate days, there will be some saving of time. It may not be that
there will be one or the other of the two languages every day, but the
principle will apply. We must reduce the hours for each. So long as we
have only the Ashram boys in the school, there is no need to provide
separately for religious instruction. It will suffice to tell them the
stories we want to at prayer time.
I am of the view that, if Kaka1 is an expert in drill, the classes
should start and end with it. It will be enough to have it for five
minutes at the commencement and five minutes at the end. This is to
be followed after the movements have been learnt. Time should be
found on one of the week days for teaching the movements. What is
taught on that day may be practised for a week.
Agricultural work will be difficult till some land has been
obtained. Perhaps it will be best to drop it for the time being. The man
who teaches us should be one who has himself been a successful
farmer. If a gardener is available, he should remain on the farm and
teach us various techniques, which we, teachers and pupils, may learn
for a year or two. We may then go into the science of agriculture. It
will not be possible to provide for some hours of agricultural work to
all the boys every day. But they can learn the work only if every week
different classes are given two or three days by turns. Forty minutes
are not enough for the purpose. They may suffice for learning the
science of agriculture theoretically. The same is true of weaving. Both
will require constant practice. It will be necessary, therefore, to set
apart days on which pupils can give at least two hours at a stretch. If
Shri Pandya knows both the theory and the practice of agriculture and
if he agrees to join, no doubt he will be very useful. As a rule, a man
coming from a Government agricultural school cannot, I believe, be
of much help to us. Ask Maganlal to tell the story of Nagin Babu of
Santiniketan. It was not his fault. How could he help it?
It is not necessary to teach carpentry till a boy is twelve. A child
is not able even to lift or use a hammer. At a later age, we shall have
no option but to teach it. It should be treated as a part of agriculture.

This is not done in India. It is, however, a kind of work which we shall
not be able to do till we have moved to our own land.
You must find a Gujarati equivalent for “workshop”. Will
karakhanu do? Someone had mentioned “metric system” in the
curriculum. Henceforward, we should be careful about using such
terms. There are so many points like these over which we have to
break our heads. If you do that, our children will enjoy the fruits.
It will be enough to give every division one hour weekly for
hygiene. The teacher should keep a watch whether the things taught in
these hours are acted upon during the rest of the week. Because the
pupil doesn’t have another hour for the subject on the other days, it
does not mean that the teacher has forgotten what he taught in that
week. If a boy attends the school with his nails grown and filled with
dirt, the teacher can ask him, even during the period for arithmetic,
why his nails are dirty and what he had been taught on this point.
It is certain that Professor (what is the Gujarati for this? Or, will
it have to be retained in the language just as it is?) Kripalani will join.
He will take a trial for some time. If the thing is not beyond his
capacity, he will join. For the present, he just cannot get away from
here.
I have written at length on some points, saying things which may
appear rather silly. My anxiety to make myself quite clear was the
reason.
Vandemataram from

MOHANDAS

Something remains yet.
Music will have to be left out till we get a teacher for it. Since
due weight is not attached to it, the thing has remained with actors and
bhaktas1 . We must consider before taking in an actor. A bhakta we are
not likely to get. Write to the Gandharva [Maha]vidyalaya and see if
you succeed. Will you please send a list of the equipment needed for
science? I hesitate to buy costly equipment before we have become
stable. If any books are wanting, it will be good if you make a list of
them as well.
Please treat all my observations as no more than suggestions for
consideration. Whether or not they should be implemented is left to
the inclinations of you all.

CHI. CHHAGANLAL,

I have received letters of both of you. The situation here has
taken a serious turn.1 Hence I shall not be able to write fully.
If it is absolutely necessary to go to Rajkot, it seems proper that
you go there. Maganlal certainly cannot leave. I very well realize that
even you cannot leave. But I am certain that one of you should be
there. If something untoward happened all of us would repent. If
Fulchand can be persuaded to go to Ahmedabad you should entrust
him with your work and go. And I suggest appointing another clerk.
If it is possible to shift to a new place for the monsoon this
should be done. But do not insist upon it too much. If the curriculum
seems too strenuous, some adjustments should be made. However,
neither weaving nor agriculture should be neglected.

I think they do everything except making the woof in the jail. I
feel that we should see how a woof made of yarn works. If the
instrument meant for use as woof can be made of yarn, it may be
necessary to have it for finer work like that of silk.
At present we have to see how much we can weave without the
help of machines. Seek the opinion of Lalji also in this connection.
Did you again get information regarding the goods sent to
Shivpujan? These things should not get misplaced in transit. Have you

tell him that we may introduce any rules of cleanliness he suggests.
You should explain to him politely but firmly that dharma does not
consist in these notions about being defiled by contact—with this or
the other thing. As Akha has sung: “That one may be defiled by
touch of others, like a superfluous limb is this notion.” Here, I am
being showered with love. There is no end to people’s suffering. I am
getting a wonderful experience of villages.
If Mavji is otherwise a good man, fix a pay for him. It is
necessary that such men get trained and pick up everything about
weaving, so that we can employ thousands of them.
Show all the accounts to the gentleman who has come forward
to pay the expenses of the Ashram. If he does, I see nothing wrong in
accepting what he gives. I am writing1 to Prabhudas to tell him that he
may now come here if he wants to. It is quite true that, had Chhaganlal
been late this time, he would have been too late to be of any help. As
things have by chance come off in time at the last hour, one feels as if
everything has been all right.
You want to know when my work here will be over. From the
magnitude of the task, it would seem that it might take years. If I go
by my faith, I think it will take six months. I have here men of sterling
worth to help me. More are likely to join. I continue to have God’s
mercy in abundance. It is not true that Prabhudas’s brain has grown
dull for want of milk. Chi. Chhaganlal wonders if this is so.The reason
is to be found in Prabhudas’s passing from one phase of growth to
another. When passing through an important change of this kind,
many people feel disturbed in one way or another. Moreover, as I
could see while teaching Prabhudas, he worked very hard competing
with Devdas. He has some excellent qualities. He has exerted himself
beyond his limits, considering his age and capacity. He feels
exhausted now.

346. LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI
BETTIAH,

Jeth Sud 11, Samvat 1973 [June 1, 1917]
CHI. MAGANLAL,

The friend Kishorelal about whom Chandulal wrote has arrived
here. But his health is not too good and I am sending him back. He is
a fine man. I have suggested to him that he may join the school. I take
it that you will let him join.
In the letter I posted this morning, I could not complete the
point towards the end. If Fulchand and Narahari were not included
among the inmates, the idea was to suggest that, at the critical hour,
they should be free to get some experience of jail here if they so
desire. It is because of Sankalchand that the school has started. Even if
he wants to, he cannot come here. I cannot imagine the school without
Kaka at present. Sankalchand cannot run it by himself. And so Kaka
must remain. He doesn’t have anything more to learn here. I think he
is a veteran. He can work hard enough. What he has to learn is to
serve, tied down to one spot, and he has now such an opportunity.
Mama can work half the time in the school and half on the loom or he
can work all the time on the loom. He is much in the same position as
Kaka. All that is to be learnt here is to suffer, when the hour comes,
and go to jail. Mama has passed the test in this school. Without
Chhotalal, how could you run the loom by yourself? For him,
moreover, going to jail is a kind of indulgence, so to say. Jail is no
hardship to him. If there is hardship anywhere, it is there. That, too, he
bears and will go on bearing. If Santok remains there, the girls will be
looked after and Vrajlal can also be free of the kitchen. Chhaganlal
can be spared if Khushalbhai has gone over there. Punjabhai will then
keep accounts as well as he may. Who will be asking for them? This is
the arrangement that occurs to me. No one from among the teachers
is obliged to join in work of this kind, nor do I expect them to. All
that I have suggested is that, even if any of them want to join, only two
can be spared. For the immediate present, however, I don’t see the
need for anyone besides Devdas to come. When you, Mama and
Chhotalal have acquired full mastery over the loom, you yourselves
will take up the fight, without depending on me, for the uplift of
handloom workers. When Sankalchand and others are in full
424

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

command of the National School, the teachers will themselves take up
the struggle for the spread of that type of education everywhere. If I
am a free man and alive, I shall join in that effort too. If not, this
struggle will have shown the way to you all.
One-pointed is the intellect
that functions with a purpose, son of Kuru!
Many-branched and infinite are the movements
of the intellect devoid of purpose.1
This covers everything.
Once we have decided what we want and are resolved not to be
deterred by anything that may follow, the developments will show us
the way. There is not much to be learnt in how I listen to people’s
tales [of suffering] and take the, statements. This contains a reply to
Mama’s letter too. Show him the whole letter. It seems you have
forgotten about the letter to Narandas, or the one from him, that you
were to send to me. You may employ any labour that may be
necessary except for weaving. As to the charges, we can go as far as
reasonable market rates. What you say about the plan of the house
seems all right to me. If you go to live there, put up the hedge
immediately. What it will be of, you may consider and decide. I have
already given the plan I should like. See that the verandahs around the
house are wide enough. It will be all right to have the teachers’ rooms
in front, as also those for Lalji and others. I can’t think [about the
arrangement] for respected Khushalbhai. You may do so yourself. It
also remains to be seen what he decides in response to my letter 2 . I
think we shall have to spend up to Rs. 20,000 on the buildings; we can
manage that. We shall be receiving Rs. 2,000 annually from Doctor
Saheb. He has not so far paid the sum [for this year] but I take it that
he will do so now. Let him know your needs. I am treating the land as
a separate item. If you think it necessary to use full-baked bricks for
the construction of the buildings, do so. The Executive Engineer there
is Mr. Tyobji. He will help you. Punjabhai was with me when he took
me to see the jail.
Yes, it is quite right to pay the salaries from the Ashram reserves.
We shall see what to do when some one donates money
for the school. The teachers’ quarters will also be constructed out of

the Ashram funds. They should, if they can, pay rent at the rate of six
per cent, or any other rate which may be considered reasonable, onthe
cost of the land and all the other expenses. This answers all your
points.
Blessi ngs from

BAPU

What Chhaganlal says about Jivanlalbhai having been paid up to
the 15th is not right. I have already arranged that a fortnight’s salary
should be remitted to him in advance and that subsequently he should
be paid on the first of every month. You can make sure by looking
into the cheque book and consulting Fulchand. It is not our idea that
we should meet our expenses in the future out of the interest. As far as
possible, we shall live within whatever we receive, unasked, for the
expenses. But, to the extent that we fail in our tapascharya, we shall
appeal for donations. This is the way all great undertakings in the
world are carried on. Institutions which are maintained out of interest
lose vitality in the end. People will maintain any institution that they
need. If the Shriji [temple] were without its rich wealth, the priests
would be more concerned with their spiritual state. The teachers need
not get alarmed by this view of mine or by the proposed arrangement.
In the notes lying with Shukla Saheb 1 and Revashankarbhai, there is
sufficient reserve to meet their needs for four years. I have, all the
same, written to the Doctor asking him to undertake the responsibility
of meeting all the expenses for the present, and I think he will. Send
him a complete estimate for the year. When I am outside [jail] the
question does not arise.

347. LETTER TO MAHARAJA BAHADUR
SIR RAMESHWAR SINGH
R ANCHI ,

June 4, 1917
DEAR MAHARAJA SAHEB BAHADUR 1 ,

In accordance with your suggestion, I reduce to writing my
views about the proposed inquiry.
In my opinion, simultaneously with the appointment of a
Committee of Enquiry (or arbitration, as suggested herein below),
there should be declaration regarding the various points referred to in
my letter to the Government dated the 13th May last. 2 Tinkathia in
every shape and form, hand-notes being balances of tawan and
hundas as in the Dhokraha kothi, should be declared as abolished or
cancelled.
I have no desire, if I can help it, to lead evidence as to the
coercive methods adopted by the planters to bend the raiyats to their
will except in so far as it may be necessary regarding sharahbeshi and
tawan. I am anxious to see cordial relations established between the
planters and the raiyats. And in any inquiry that is the result of a
mutual understanding, an investigation into methods of coercion can
find no place.
There would then remain only the question of sharahbeshi,
sattas and individual hardships, in the shape of raiyats having been
dispossessed of their lands, etc., and the refund of tawan and
sharahbeshi already taken. These the Committee will investigate.
Sharahbeshi payments should meanwhile be suspended.
The Committee will confine its attention to sharahbeshi sattas
not covered by the forthcoming judgment of the High Court, the latter
to be accepted as final by both the parties. Inquiry into sharahbeshi
sattas will then naturally be postponed till after the judgment of the
High Court.
Upon the Committee being appointed, the scope of our work
will be altered. It will then consist in collecting, collating and leading
evidence and in simultaneously carrying out the educative and

protective programme sketched before you.
Such a Committee, then, may be in the nature of an arbitration
of which the planters’ and the raiyats’ nominees (one of each) will be
members with the right to them to appoint an umpire. The decision of
the arbitration should be treated as final and binding on both the
parties. Behind it, in the place of judicial authority, will be that of the
Government, if either party failed to carry out the award of the
arbitration. This is a domestic quarrel and if it is settled in the manner
indicated by me, it will create a healthy precedent.
If, however, it may not be in the nature of an arbitration, it will
then be a Committee appointed by the Government, two members
being the same as under the arbitration scheme and the president
being a High Court Judge.
If there is any point herein which requires elucidation and if it is
so desired, I shall be prepared to wait on the Council at any time
required.
I remain,
Yours sincerely,

348. INTERVIEW WITH LT.-GOVERNOR OF BIHAR1
June 5, 1917
I discussed with Mr. Gandhi this afternoon, Chief Secretary being present, the
question of the step to be taken in connection with the Champaran situation. I
explained to Mr. Gandhi that he had now had ample time to obtain all the information
he needed, and that the raiyats were getting in an excited state, and it was ecessary in
some way to put an end to a situation which was rapidly becoming a d angerous one. It
is impossible for Mr. Gandhi himself to settle the questions which have been raised,
as the planters would not recognise his authority; also for him to attempt to do so
would be assuming the functions of Government. Government had intended to
postpone their consideration of the points at issue until the settlement report had
been received, but they recognise that, in present circumstances, this is no longer
possible. It was decided, therefore, to appoint a Committee consisting of a senior

revenue officer from another province (Mr. Sly) as President, and the following
members:—Mr. Rainy, Deputy Secretary, Financial Department, Government of
India; Mr. Adami, Legal Remembrancer; Mr. D. Reid, representative of the planters
on the Legislative Council; Raja Harihar Prasad Narayan Singh of Amawan, as the
representative of the zamindars; and Mr. Gandhi himself as the representative of the
raiyats. The appointment of the last three gentleman, of course, could only be made
with their consent, and I asked Mr. Gandhi if he would agree to serve. He said at first
that he would prefer to remain outside the Committee, so that he might lead the
evidence. But, after some discussion, he admitted that there were advantages in his
being on the Committee, provided that it was recognised by Government that he had
his own pronounced views which he might not readily change, and also that he would
wish to place his own evidence before the Committee in the form of a written
statement, on which the other members of the Committee would of course examine
him. He also wished that he might be given freedom to produce witnesses for
examination. I said that even if he were on the Committee, he would have as much
freedom in these respects as if he had remained outside it. Mr. Gandhi then asked for
time to consult Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, and promised to let me know his
decision as soon as he had seen that gentleman at Bankipore.
Mr. Gandhi agreed that the following terms of reference to the Committee
were suitable, namely:
“To enquire into the relations between landlord and tenant in the Champaran
district as also into all disputes arising out of the manufacture and cultivation
of indigo. The Committee to examine the material already available,
supplementing it by such further enquiry, local and otherwise, as they consider
desirable. They should report their conclusions to Government, if possible by
the 15th October, and state the measures they recommend in order to remove
any abuse or grievance which they might find to exist.”
Mr. Gandhi asked if it might be taken as certain that the above terms of
reference covered all the points I mentioned in his note of 13th May1 , including the
question of sharahbeshi sattas, although a case relating to them is pending in the
High Court. I replied in the affirmative.
Mr. Gandhi presumed that the term “material already available” would include
any evidence which he might wish to tender. I again replied in the affirmative.
Mr. Gandhi said that in his opinion the proceedings of the Committee should
be of an informal and summary nature. I said I was inclined to agree but thought this
might be left to the discretion of the Commissioners.
Mr. Gandhi, on his part, undertakes at once to put a stop to his
1

Vide “Report on Condition of Ryots in Champaran”, 13-5-1917.

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

429

enquiry and to abstain henceforth from taking a single statement, and also
from visiting any dehat or allowing any of his assistants to do so. Mr.
Gandhi does not want the raiyats to feel that
‘A’

he has deserted them, and is unwilling on that account to leave the district
altogether, pending the assembly of the Committee. But he undertakes not
to go beyond Bettiah and Motihari; after short visits to these places, he will
go on a visit to Ahmedabad.

Mr. Gandhi asked that orders should issue at once putting a stop to illegal acts,
such as the levy of abwabs and the impressment of labour. I said we could not do this
unless at the same time we issued a notice which the planters asked us to issue, stating
that Mr. Gandhi had no official recognition. Mr. Gandhi said he would be quite
willing to see both statements made; but finally he agreed that in lieu of any such
notice precise instructions should be issued to the local officers to take vigorous
action to prevent all abuses that may come to light. For instance, the taking of
abwabs must, as far as possible, be finally stopped, use being made where necessary
of the power of refusing to renew leases. Similarly, the illegal impressment of labour,
carts and ploughs must by all means be prevented wherever it comes to notice.
Mr. Gandhi asked that warnings should be sent to planters not to impress carts
or coolies or collect abwabs, etc., during the interval which will elapse before the
report of the Committee is received. I replied that the planters would take offence, if
Government were to issue such a warning, as it would imply a prejudging of their
case, but said that when the planter-member of the Committee is appointed, I would
point out to him the harm that would be done if such practices occurred, and ask him
to consider the desirability of making such a communication to his brother-planters.
The following action should now be taken:—

430

(1)

The Government of India should be informed briefly of the decision
arrived at, and it should be mentioned that Mr. Tanner has been selected
as Secretary instead of Mr. Tallents.

(2)

Mr. Reid and the Raja of Amawan should be asked if they will serve on
the Committee.

(3)

A letter should be sent to the Commissioner informing him of the fact
that it has been decided to refer the whole question of the agrarian
conditions in Champaran to a Committee, the constitution of which will
be communicated to him as soon as possible and that, meanwhile, Mr.
Gandhi has agreed (as at ‘A’ above). The Planters’ Association should
also be informed of the decision arrived at.

(4)

A short resolution to be drafted appointing the Committee, so that it

settled.

All of us arrived here today. The indigo planters are out to
make trouble and therefore my return might be delayed. l will see.
Herewith a postcard. If, as slated in it, the man comes there, take
him in. If he knows Hindi, entrust him with teaching work. Otherwise,
any other work you think him fit for. I have asked him to go there
directly.
As for your going to Rajkot, do what you think is proper.2
Prabhudas’s body is getting quite strong. Though he still suffers
from headaches, that does not matter.
Very fine work was done at Ranchi.3 Devdas has given you a full
report. I myself am not in a position to write more. The reports which
Devdas sends also should not appear in the newspapers.

Bhai Pragji has asked for money. I have told him that volunteers
must not be enlisted by paying them. Boarding and lodging is all that
may be offered to them. The travelling expenses also should be borne
by them. I see no harm in the matter relating to the Doctor being
printed in Rajkot. But the cost must not exceed what it would be in
Ahmedabad.

352. LETTER TO ESTHER FAERING
BETTIAH,

June 9, 1917
MY DEAR ESTHER,

As you will have seen from the papers sent to you, I have been
to Ranchi, from which place I returned only yesterday to find your
letters.
Yours is a difficult question to answer. The total effect of European activity has not been for the good of India. The general body of
Europeans who have come to India have succumbed to the vices of
the East instead of imposing their own virtues on the East. It could not
well be otherwise. Religion has not made a lasting impression on them,
as we see demonstrated even by the present war. My theory is that
modern civilization is decidedly anti-Christian. And what Europeans
have brought to India is that civilization, not the life of Jesus. You and
a handful of others are striving to represent that life. It is bound to
leave its mark upon the soil. But it must take time. “The mills of God
grind slowly.” You and people like you are not affected by the evil
that stares you in the face. You get behind it, discover the good lying
underneath and add it to your own stock, thus producing a perfect
blend. What I want is a reciprocity of that method. And so I welcomed
your visit to the Ashram, as I welcome that of many European friends
who are true to their best traditions and are broadminded enough to
take in the best that this land has to give. Have I made myself clear?
Please discuss this further and freely with me.
I am likely to serve on the Committee the Government are about
to appoint. I am presently framing a general note1 which will give you
the details of the visit to Ranchi. It was a good thing I went.
Mrs. Gandhi and Devdas are here now and so is Polak. Had I
been arrested, Mrs. Gandhi and Devdas would have worked among the
poor raiyats and heartened them for the struggle. I am most anxious
for you to meet Mrs. Gandhi at the earliest moment.
Please don’t think that I am killing myself with work.
With love from us all,
Yours,

BAPU

I have your letter. I was a little sad to read it. You depict your
condition to be very miserable. One does so to some extent and then
gets out of it. But this letter of yours instead of showing such spirit
creates an impression that you are never going to get out of your
melancholy. I shall be very much disappointed if such is going to be
the result. I have entertained high hopes about you and expected that
you will ultimately get strong and will most certainly put up a fight.
There is no need of volunteers just now. They will be required
after four months. You will be able to play your part as a volunteer
only if you shake off your melancholy and get strong. You will have
to do the work without any remuneration. Will M[anibhai] allow you

DEAR MR. McPHERSON,

I thank you for your letter of the 9th instant. The Associated
Press message1 becomes a perfect mystery if it is taken for granted,
as I think it must be, that the leakage could not have taken place from
my side. Apart from the intrinsic evidence the message bears of
not having been received from my side, I may say that I had given the
details of the interview to no one in Bankipore before 6 p.m., i.e., till
after the arrival of the Hon’ble Pundit Malaviyaji and several things
alluded to in the message were not even mentioned during the
conversation2 I had with Mr. Malaviyaji and four other friends.

found myself in the company of some very dear Christian friends. I
have read it again today with better appreciation if one may write in
this manner of a sacred work like this. For me truth and love are
interchangeable terms. You may not know that the Gujarati for passive
resistance is truth-force. I have variously defined it as truth-force,
love-force or soul-force. But truly there is nothing in words. What one
has to do is to live a life of love in the midst of the hate we see
everywhere. And we cannot do it without unconquerable faith in its
efficacy. A great queen named Mirabai lived two or three hundred
years ago. She forsook her husband and everything and lived a life of
absolute love. Her husband at last became her devotee. We often sing
in the Ashram some fine hymns composed by her. You shall hear and
one of these days sing them when you come to the Ashram.
Thank you for the precious gift. I need such thoughts as are
contained in the work.
With love,
Yours,

357. LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL GANDHI
MOTIHARI ,

Jeth Vad 6 [June 11, 1917] 1
CHI. CHHAGANLAL,

I have come to Motihari for a day. I have noticed that by
mistake, Devdas has put the letter in my bag. I am returning it. I saw
here the Nitishatak which was sent for Prabhudas. It carries a shloka,
the meaning of which is given thus: ‘Just as a good woman wants her
breasts pinched with nails as sharp as sword, similarly a brave man
wants his chest—the symbol of victory, attacked by swords as sharp as
nails’. I felt very unhappy on reading it. There is hardly any book
which does not carry something that needs to be omitted before we
put it into the hands of the children. How could Bhartrihari write such
shlokas in his Nitishatak. Only in an age of extreme debauchery can
one think of such thoughts. I find it simply impossible that any
woman, leading a disciplined life, would want her breasts pinched or
any good man would enjoy making such assaults. That suggests a
highly debauched state. A good woman can never be in such a state.
Such comparison cannot even be thought of while writing shlokas for
the Nitishatak. That such shlokas and ideas are found even in good
collections, brings to mind two things. First, that in our original books,
the periods of debauchery and self-control have been mixed up.
Second, that the compilers of this age give little thought to the
contents of the literature they place before the society. Under these
circumstances, we have to give books to the children after careful
consideration of the contents. After reading the above mentioned
shloka, an innocent child like Prabhudas would feel that to pinch a
young woman’s breasts is not something bad and that even a
righteous man can derive such pleasure. We will have to make great
efforts to improve this atmosphere and save our youth. Some of these
writings should be shown to the young people and then the
viciousness pointed out. For, we cannot keep such vicious books
hidden from them for long. So I feel that whatever book we give to

DEAR MR. MCPHERSON,

I went over to Motihari yesterday and formally stopped the
taking of statements. I have told the raiyats that the Government are
about to appoint a committee of inquiry which is likely to commence
its work about the middle of July next and which will listen to their
tale in so far as it may be necessary. And I have told them that in view
of the above mentioned decision of the Government, it is no longer
necessary for me to take their statements.
I am shifting the headquarters to Motihari where my work and
that of my colleagues will consist in studying and analysing the
evidence we have already collected and in putting it in a presentable
form. The raiyats will still continue to come to us for information and
guidance. I do notice that to allow them to talk to us in any manner
they choose is a great relief to them and they readily accept the advice
that is given to them. They are being told not to disturb the existing
situation pending the inquiry except where it is manifestly illegal and
in no case to take the law in their own hands.
I am not leaving for Ahmedabad till the resolution1
appointing the committee is published and the hot controversy going
on in the Press has subsided a little. If you could please drop me a
wire as to when the resolution is likely to be gazetted, I shall be
obliged.

360. NOTE ON THE SITUATION IN CHAMPARAN-VI
CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT FOR PUBLICATION

MOTIHARI,

June 17, 1917
As it will be remembered, prior to the publication of the
Government Resolution1 appointing the Committee of Inquiry, Mr.
Gandhi was summoned to Ranchi, the Government intention then
being to remove him and his co-workers from Champaran. There was
an exhaustive discussion2 of the whole situation between the
Lieutenant-Governor and Mr. Gandhi. The latter saw also the other
members of the Executive Council 3 and after two days’ discussion
the Government desired to appoint a Committee and suggested that, in
that event, Mr. Gandhi should stop taking statements. He readily
accepted the suggestion. The Lieutenant-Governor inquired if he
would then withdraw his co-workers and himself from Champaran.
Mr. Gandhi said he could not do so, and his colleagues and he would
be occupied in marshalling the evidence and preparing for the
Committee. They could not do this well, out of Champaran. Moreover,
he could not let the raiyats think that he had, in any way, deserted
them. The Lieutenant-Governor then did not press the point but
hoped that, pending the meeting of the Committee, neither Mr.
Gandhi nor his companions would go to the villages. This, too, was
agreed to. The taking of statements and visits to the villages have now
been entirely stopped. The headquarters have been removed to

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Motihari and one of the workers remains at Bettiah to attend to the
raiyats who may desire information or assistance. In all cases, they are
being advised, pending the result of the inquiry, not to disturb the
existing situation and it is Mr. Gandhi’s firm opinion that whilst the
mission has undoubtedly strengthened the raiyats in their resolve to
combat coercion and heartened them for a struggle to gain their
freedom, its presence serves to restrain any excess on the part of the
raiyats who without guidance might easily be betrayed into action
which might harm them in the end. The Committee meets about the
15th of July.1 During the interval, Mr. Gandhi is paying a flying visit
to Ahmedabad, returning to Motihari at the latest on the 28th instant.
As to the constitution of the Committee, Mr. Gandhi has
accepted his own appointment on the clear understanding that he
should be free to give his own evidence and prepare and give the
evidence of the raiyats and be as to this in the same position in which
he would be if he was not a member of the Committee. He has done
so with the approval of the Hon’ble Pandit Malaviyaji and Bihar
friends, whom he met at Bankipore on his return from Ranchi. The
other nominations seem to have been made by the Government with
much care and with a view to secure an equitable finding by the
Committee. There was throughout the discussion at Ranchi a deep
desire on the part of the Lieutenant-Governor to arrive at a fair
settlement.
An unauthorised statement has been circulated by the
Associated Press to the effect that Mr. Gandhi has advised private
inquiry. In substance the report is true. Evidence collected is of an
inflammatory nature and a heated newspaper discussion of the
evidence is bound to create an atmosphere which will interfere with
the conducting of a dispassionate inquiry. The mission has no wish to
unnecessarily injure the planters’ interest and so in their interest and
to demonstrate that the mission desired nothing but justice for the
raiyats, a private inquiry was suggested. The raiyats could not be hurt
by this procedure. It is not to be inferred that the report was to be
withheld from the public. On the appearance, however, of the Associated Press statement, Mr. Gandhi wired2 to the Government saying
that, as the suggestion was wholly in the planters interest, he withdrew

it and would welcome a public inquiry if the planters so desired. It
should be understood that whilst no more volunteers are required at
present, no matter what the final result of the Government inquiry is,
they will be required soon after the publication of the Government’s
decision on the Committees report. Their work will be the most
important and lasting and therefore it will be the final and essential
stage of the mission. Volunteers should, without any advertisement in
the Press, be got ready and where they do not know Hindi but possess
other qualifications, they should be advised to learn Hindi sufficient
for the purpose. They have to be grown up, reliable, hard-working
men who would not mind taking the spade and repairing or making
village roads and cleaning village cesspools and who will in their
dealings with the landlords guide the raiyats aright. Six months of
such training cannot fail to do incalculable good to the raiyats, the
workers and the country at large.

MOTIHARI,

June 17, 1917
MY DEAR ESTHER,

I am going to Ahmedabad for 4 days. I return on the 28th
instant at the latest. There is no secret about what I have and you have
every right to ask. My faith in Truth and Love is as vivid as in the fact
that I am writing this to you. To me they are convertible terms Truth
and Love conquer all.

362. TALK WITH TEACHERS OF THE NATIONAL SCHOOL
[AHMEDABAD ,

June 23, 1917] 1
I take it that all of you have dedicated your lives to the school
and I should like, therefore, to acquaint you with the present state of
our finances. We have Rs. 10,000 in cash in the Ashram Fund. Besides
this, I have jewellery and other gifts worth Rs. 20,000 given to me
when I left for India. A friend, again, has promised to buy and donate
land and this should mean Rs. 10,000. We have thus a total of Rs.
40,000 or thereabouts. It is my wish that the gifts l have received
should not be put to sale in my life-time, though of course they will
be used in the service of the nation and we may dispose of them if we
find that necessary. This means that, even if we get no help just now
and the position continues as at present, we have enough money to
meet our needs for four years. I am confident, though, that we shall
get all the money we need. It may happen, however, that we displease
everyone as a result of our principles and that we get no money. At
such a time, the teachers will have two courses open to them. One that
they leave the school and take up some other work. As for this, none
of you is so entirely good for nothing that he cannot make a living
somehow. The other course is to continue to run the school, no matter
what happens, maintaining yourselves, if need be, on no more than the
plainest bread. If it becomes necessary for you even to go begging for
money, you should. In other words, you should be ready to turn
yourselves into beggars for the sake of the school.
OBJECTS OF S CHOOL

l. To adopt a new method of education.
2. To pay special attention to character-building, the aim being
that ten per cent of the pupils at any rate get trained for
national service.
3. To raise the status of the Gujarati language.
4. To work for the spread of the national language, Hindi.
5. To open schools of the new pattern in every place, and make
this school a model for them, and for Government as well, to

R EQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS

1. Knowledge of Hindi and Marathi

3. Well-preserved health
4. Travel in India

Text-books

C O-EDUCATION

I am myself in favour of co-education, but I don’t insist on it if
the teachers hold a different opinion.
I am not in favour of common residence. Girls should not be
kept in a hostel. I am of the view that they must live under the
constant supervision of their mothers and nowhere else.
There should be holidays in summer and the school should be
shifted to a cooler place. This, I believe, will enable the teacher and the
pupils to work very much better at other times. The teachers and the
pupils should spend the holidays together.
English should be an optional subject. One should know good,
at any rate correct, English. It would be excellent if we could get an
English teacher for the purpose, but I can think of no one at present
except Miss Schlesin. If only she would come, we could want nothing
better. She is a very capable person. A pupil of the school should be
able to talk in English with any Englishman without being nervous.
Drawing will be taught not as a fine art2 but because the pupil
should be able to draw for practical purposes, draw maps, for instance,
and straight lines, have a good hand-writing and should know
memory drawing.

Rules should be framed for discipline1 in the school, but no
compulsion should be used to enforce obedience to them; they [the
pupil] should feel inclined to obey them on their own. One should
keep a watch on them whether they do. If any of them does not, we
should express our disapproval and advise him.
To start with, 100 pupils should be admitted to the school, all of
whom can pay for their own expenses. Nothing may be spent from
the School Fund for any of the pupils. If there is a good but poor
student, we may secure help for him from one of our friends and beg
of another for his fees; but the School Fund cannot be used for the
purpose.
History, Geography, Science and Hygiene can be part of
Gujarati.
We have necessarily to come into contact with people from the
South, and this is to our benefit too; everyone should, therefore, know
Marathi.

MOTIHARI,

June 29, 1917
DEAR MR. McPHERSON,

Your letter of the 18th instant followed me whilst I was
travelling. I returned from Ahmedabad yesterday afternoon after an
absence of eleven days. My co-workers have not made it a point of
absenting themselves from Champaran but most of them have been
absent off and on for their own businesses. They have not been in
evidence as their work has been confined to preparing for me a digest
of the evidence collected by me and giving information to the
inquirers. There is I think complete absence of stir as the taking of
evidence and visits to the dehats have been religiously avoided.
Yours sincerely,

366. REPLY REGARDING DRESS TO “THE PIONEER”
MOTIHARI,

June 30, 1917
SIR,

I have hitherto successfully resisted the temptation of either
answering your or Mr. Irwin’s criticism of the humble work I am
doing in Champaran. Nor am I going to succumb now except with
regard to a matter which Mr. Irwin has thought fit to dwell upon and
about which he has not even taken the trouble of being correctly
informed. I refer to his remarks on my manner of dressing.
My “familiarity with the minor amenities of western
civilization” has taught me to respect my national costume, and it
may interest Mr. Irwin to know that the dress I wear in Champaran is
the dress I have always worn in India except that for a very short
period in India I fell an easy prey in common with the rest of my
countrymen to the wearing of semi-European dress in the courts and
elsewhere outside Kathiawar. I appeared before the Kathiawar Courts
now 21 years ago in precisely the dress I wear in Champaran.
One change I have made and it is that having taken to the
occupation of weaving and agriculture and having taken the vow of
swadeshi, my clothing is now entirely hand-woven and hand-sewn and
made by me or my fellow-workers. Mr. Irwin’s letter suggests that I
appear before the ryots in a dress I have temporarily and specially
adopted in Champaran to produce an effect. The fact is that I wear the
national dress because it is the most natural and the most becoming
for an Indian. I believe that our copying of the European dress is a
sign of our degradation, humiliation and our weakness; and that we
are committing a national sin in discarding a dress which is best suited
to the Indian climate and which, for its simplicity, art and cheapness, is
not to be beaten on the face of the earth and which answers hygienic
requirements. Had it not been for a false pride and equally false
notions of prestige, Englishmen here would long ago have adopted
the Indian constume. I may mention incidentally that I do not go
about Champaran bare-headed. I do avoid shoes for sacred reasons,
but I find too that it is more natural and healthier to avoid them
whenever possible.
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

447

I am sorry to inform Mr. Irwin and your readers that my
esteemed friend Babu Brijkishore Prasad, the “Ex-hon. member of
council,” still remains unregenerate and retains the provincial cap and
never walks barefoot and “kicks up” a terrible noise even in the
house we are living in by wearing wooden sandals. He has still not the
courage, in spite of most admirable contact with me, to discard his
semi-anglicised dress and whenever he goes to see officials puts his
legs into the bifurcated garment and on his own admission tortures
himself by cramping his feet in inelastic shoes. I cannot induce him to
believe that his clients won’t desert him and the courts won’t punish
him if he wore his more becoming and less expensive “dhoti”. I
invite you and Mr. Irwin not to believe the “stories” that the latter
hears about me and my friends, but to join me in the crusade against
educated Indians abandoning their manners, habits and customs which
are not proved to be bad or harmful. Finally, I venture to warn you
and Mr. Irwin that you and he will ill-serve the cause both of you
consider is in danger by reason of my presence in Champaran if you
continue, as you have done, to base your strictures on unproved facts.
I ask you to accept my assurance that I should deem myself unworthy
of the friendship and confidence of hundreds of my English friends
and associates—not all of them fellow-cranks—if in similar
circumstances I acted towards them differently from my own
countrymen.

MOTIHARI,

MY DEAR ESTHER,

I have your two letters before me. I returned from Ahmedabad
on the 28th. I had a nice time there.
The city life I have always found, to be chilling; the village life,
free, invigorating and godly.
‘Why has God given us so many gifts, powers, skill to invent if
we are not to use them?’ You have asked a question which I have
asked myself and thousands are always asking. My humble opinion is

448

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

that God has placed temptations in our way the strength of which is
the same as that of the possibilities of rise in moral grandeur. We may
use our inventive faculty either for inward growth or for outward
indulgence. I may devote my talents for utilizing the falls from
the Himalayas; I only increase mankind’s facilities for indulgence. I
may use my talents for discovering laws which govern the falls from
the Himalayas within me; I serve myself and mankind by adding to
the permanent happiness. You will make up for yourself countless
illustrations showing that all our talents are to be utilized only for
inward growth which can come from self-restraint alone.
Do please remember me to Mr. Bittmann 1 and thank him on
my behalf for permitting you to come to the Ashram whenever you
are free.
Your experience of the young man is nothing extraordinary.
Pray do not be impatient to reform men and women whom you meet.
The first and the last thing we have to attend to is to reform ourselves.
In trying to reform, we seem to be judging. These young men often
become worse for our handling. The safest course is to let such men
leave us when they are found wanting. I have not sufficiently
expressed myself. But you will understand. If not, please ask.
Yours,

the present moment upon the villages by you, Mr. Jinnah and such
other leaders cannot but end in arrests. This propaganda must be
carried on in spite of Government prohibition and to that extent it
may be considered illegal but for a passive resister not unlawful.
There are various other methods which I am unwilling to advise until
passive resistance in its present form has soaked into us a bit.
This, however, I should like to add that in this method there is
no idea of punishment of the wrong-doer. There can, therefore, be no
retaliation and no boycott. But there should be swadeshi of the purest
type, not as a retaliatory measure but as the law of our being. We are
bound in honour, being Indians, to prefer Indian goods to any other.
I do hope that whatever shape our action takes, the time-limit
resolution will be accepted by you and our friend, and that we will not
rest until the interned1 are released.

F OR P RIVATE C IRCULATION ONLY

MOTIHARI,
C HAMPARAN,

Ashadh Sud 11, Samvat 1973 [July 1, 1917] 1
DEAR FRIEND,

All these days the expenses on the Satyagraha Ashram and its
various activities could be met entirely from help voluntarily given by
some friends; but these activities have now expanded so much that it
does not seem possible to meet the expenses without asking for help.
The activities of the Ashram can be divided under the following
heads:
(1) Boarding and lodging expenses of the Ashram inmates: The
present strength of the Ashram, including adults and children,
may be put down at 30. The expenses on their account,
including rent, amount to Rs. 400/- a month. This figure
includes expenditure on guests.
(2) Hand-weaving: No one in the Ashram knew this two years ago.
Today practically everyone knows something of it. Some of
them may actually be regarded as experts. There are seven
looms working in the Ashram and five more under its
supervision. This activity has taken up a capital of Rs. 3,000/-.
Cloth gets sold as soon as it is produced. Cloth worth Rs. 500/has been sold up to this time. This work has enabled four
families which had given up weaving to resume it and in all 17
persons make their living by it. One family has learnt weaving
recently and taken to it for a living. It cannot be said yet that it
makes enough for a livelihood. The expectation
is that in ten years thousands of weavers who have given up
weaving as a profession will have resumed it. It is admitted
on all hands that, even if the textile mills stay, there is sufficient
scope in the country for hand-weaving. This activity involves
some loss at present but ultimately there should benone. The
current expenditure may be put down at Rs. 100/- a month.

452

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

[(3)]

The third activity is the National School. We in the
Ashram believe that the great harm that is being done to the
country will continue so long as education is not given along
national lines. Accordingly, a National School has been started
as an experiment. The aim is to give higher education through
the mother tongue and in a manner that will impose no strain. If
the experiment succeeds, the intention is to ask the Government
itself to provide such education, and to carry on ceaseless
agitation for the purpose. Likewise, if the success of the
experiment can be demonstrated, it is likely that private
enterprise may start other experiments of a similar nature. In
this experiment, both mental and physical education is provided.
A curriculum extending over 13 years is visualized. This will
include, besides training corresponding to a graduate’s,
instruction in the Hindi language, in agriculture and weaving.
The responsibility for conducting this experiment has been
undertaken by Professor Sankalchand Shah, formerly Professor
of Science at Gujarat College. He has worked for ten years with
Professor Gajjar1 . His assistants are Shri Narahari Parikh, LL.B.,
Shri Dattatreya Kalelkar, B.A., Shri Fulchand Shah, B.A., Shri
Kishorelal Mashruwala 2 , B.A.,LL.B., and my nephew,
Chhaganlal Gandhi. We are looking for one or two more
teachers, who should be men of character. In the study of
Sanskrit, Shastri Girijashankar of Ahmedabad has been giving
help. Professor Anandshankar Dhruva supervises the experiment
and makes suggestions. Help is also sought from other men of
learning. The teachers draw maintenance allowance according to
their needs. The experiment costs at present Rs 500/- a month.
This does not include rent since it has been included in the
expenditure for the Ashram. The number of students at present
is 12. The experiment has reached such a stage that it is
proposed to admit day students now. So far, the students were
either boys from the Ashram or sons of the teachers.
[(4)] The fourth activity is propagation of the Hindi language. There
is no room for any difference of opinion about Hindi being

entitled to the place which is at present usurped by English, but,
to our misfortune, such a difference does exist. The educated
class must have a common language and that can only be Hindi.
It will be easy to work among the masses through it. And
therefore the delay in Hindi gaining its rightful place means so
much of harm to the nation. Efforts are being made in the
country to stop this harm. The work by the Ashram will add one
more to these efforts. The first step in this work consists mainly
in securing Hindi teachers and training them. I estimate the
monthly expenditure on this work at not less than Rs. 200/-.
[(5)]
The fifth category consists of my political activities, on
such matters only in which I can see my way. The only
expenditure in this is on railway fare for me and my co-workers.
It hardly comes to Rs. l00/- a month. So far, I have had to make
no effort to find it. All the same, I include it here.
Thus, the total monthly expenditure comes to:
Rs.
For running Ashram
400
Weaving
100
School
500
Propagation of Hindi
200
My railway fare
100
1,300
approximately.
The expenditure on the National School will increase by and by,
so that it will not be an over-estimate to put the total expenditure at Rs.
1,500/-.
A large plot of land is required for all these activities. Such a
plot, admeasuring about 55 bighas, has already been purchased on the
banks of the Sabarmati near the Sabarmati jail. Efforts are proceeding
to buy some more. A workshop for weaving, living rooms, kitchens
for the Ashram and a building for the National School are to be
constructed on this land. This is likely to cost Rs. 100,000. The
responsibility for supervising the building construction has been taken
over by Shri Amritlal Thakkar of the Hind Sevak Samaj1 .
My needs, therefore, adding a year’s expenses to the cost of
the buildings, come to Rs. 118,000. For the land, I have drawn upon
1

454

Servants of India Society

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

the funds with me. There will be a trust for this land and the buildings.
If these ventures meet with your approval, I have no option but
to hold out my hand to you and you have none but to give, to the best
of your means, and induce others to give to the best of theirs. If you
desire to help only in regard to a particular item in the programme,
your contribution will be spent accordingly. Even if, however, you see
nothing but eccentricity in all my activities, it is my request that all
those who know me should help me that I may satisfy my own self. So
long as I do not myself see my error, these activities will remain my
very life. They sum up my services to the country. I wanted to go
myself and see you personally but I see no possibility of my being
free to leave Champaran for about nine months. The activities will
continue meanwhile and so also the expenses.
I don’t want at present to go a-begging through newspapers.
Before doing so, it is necessary to make some progress with the work
and gather more experience. Kindly send what help you can directly
to Satyagraha Ashram, Ahmedabad; alternatively, you may send it to
me at the Motihari address. I also request you to obtain some help
from your friends, if you possibly can. If you are not in a position
yourself to offer monetary help, I would like you to solicit such help
from friends who can. I do not want anyone to move outside his own
circle for the purpose.
Careful accounts are maintained for all categories of activities. It
is intended to circulate an abstract of the accounts among friends
every year.
You may ask me any questions you like to.

CHI. MAGANLAL,

I have written 2 to Mr. Ewbank 3 and told him that my ignorance
of the subject is profound. I shall be busy in Champaran for some
months. If, all the same, he wants me to speak, in the hope that I shall
have the time, and if he sends me literature on the subject, I shall try to
write out something4 .
Never mind if you have kept on the house-maid for some time
longer. I had a letter from Fakira. In reply 5 , I have asked him to go
there. You and Chhotalal must get rid of cooking and miscellaneous
chores. Unless that is done, I am, afraid, we shall make no progress in
weaving. How this can be brought about, it is for you to consider. Set
Satyadevji 6 to the quern. It doesn’t matter if he has been supplied
chillies. That is a yajna7 for us on his account. Let us see if it is
rewarded. I wonder. One needn’t worry if he takes chillies only for
the sake of health. A yajna must be performed cheerfully. We have
done what we have done because we think it right and so must we do
everything and supply him [the chillies] with love and in cheerfulness.
I am sending the enclosed cutting to be preserved. You must
have ordered Pataliputra there. I heard in Prayag that the best paper
is supposed to be Pratap. I was also told that its editor8 is a man of
utter self-sacrifice.

CHI. RAMDAS,

I have your letter. You need not feel shy in writing to me freely.
I have no desire to put any kind of pressure on you. Go on expressing
freely your views. I see no difficulty in your taking a salary from
Phoenix. Now Phoenix will not get help from the public. It has to
depend for its ventures entirely on subscriptions. Still, if you do not
wish to continue in the press, you may do what you want after
consulting Ch. Manilal and Mr. West. Never make important changes

needs help. Whatever the circumstances, remain cheerful. Let me
know how your health is now. You can adopt our dress when you have
made up your mind. The world will talk and then be quiet. Ba, Devdas
and Prabhudas are with me. This time I paid a visit to Madras. I have
brought along Surendra from there. He had been suffering from
constipation. Here too we have introduced Ashram rules. The work
goes on smoothly. The activities the Ashram have expanded
considerably. There is hope that the national school will grow into
something beautiful. We shall see what the final outcome is. The
activity is making good progress. Ba keeps very good health. She
appears to be liking it here very much. Let me know if you have kept
up any kind of reading or not. Did you write to Cachalia Seth and
Mr. Naidu? Do write to Phillips also. Manilal should write to Dr. Gul.
What happened to Naransamy Parthasarathi? What does he do? What
is Kuppu doing? Does he write sometimes? Have you kept up
walking? Send me your daily diary. Do you do the morning prayer?
Remember as much as you can of our rules. Follow them to the extent
you can. It will be useful in the long run.

376. CIRCULAR LETTER FOR FUNDS FOR ASHRAM
MOTIHARI,
C HAMPARAN,

[On or after July 3, 1917] 1
DEAR MR. SHASTRIAR,

I have been conducting the Satyagraha Ashram at Ahmedabad
now for the last two years. The object of the Ashram is to bring
together men, women and children whose aim or whose parents’ aim
for their children is national service for life. The Ashram at present
contains after much weeding out 30 inmates including men, women
and children. So long as its activity was confined to self-training, its
1

expenses were met from support given by friends without the
necessity of a formal appeal being made to them. The expenses
including those of a considerable number of temporary visitors have
amounted to Rs. 400/- per month on an average.
But its activity has gradually widened and includes (i) weaving
by means of handlooms, (ii) an experiment in evolving a national type
of education, (iii) spread of Hindi as a common medium for educated
India.
These activities mean much greater expenditure of money than
has come to me as above stated. For developing them a permanent
habitation on a fairly large plot of land is a necessity. Out of funds
already in my possession over fifty bighas of land has been purchased
on the banks of the Sabarmati on a healthy site some distance from
the central gaol. It affords an easy access to the College students who
have in ever-increasing numbers been making use of the Ashram
Library which contains a fair volume of selected literature and
newspapers and magazines, the latter being kindly supplied free of
charge by the respective publishers. According to a rough estimate
made by Mr. Amritlal Thakkar of the Servants of India Society, who is
drawing up the plans, the cost of the buildings will be Rs. 100,000.
The educational experiment is costing Rs. 500/- per month. The
handloom industry Rs. 100/- per month. The Hindi propaganda for
the ensuing year will cost Rs. 200/- per month. The educational and
Hindi expenditure are a progressive charge. To these may be added
my own travelling expenses Rs. 100/- per month in connection with
one public activity or other. These last are easily met. Thus the whole
figure comes to capital expenditure of Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 1,300, say
Rs. 1500, allowing extra Rs. 200/- per month for progressive
expenditure, making rupees 18,000/- for the next twelve months.
I shall attempt only the briefest description of the activities
mentioned above.
The handloom weaving is in a dying condition. Everyone
admits that whatever may be the future of the mill industry, the
handlooms ought not to be allowed to perish. Dr. Mann1 in his recent
pamphlet says that probably one of the causes of the growing poverty
observed by him in particular villages was the destruction of
handlooms which complemented agricultural occupation. The object
of the Ashram, therefore, is for every inmate to learn hand-weaving
1

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

459

and thus study at first hand the secrets and defects of the art and then
find out the means of saving the industry. Every inmate, though none
belongs to the weaving class, now knows something of the art. And a
few have attained considerable skill in the art. The Ashram is already
supporting weaving families numbering 17 souls and one family
having learnt the art at the Ashram has set up inde-pendently and is
trying to support itself from the business. Seven looms are working at
the Ashram. It has involved a capital expenditure of Rs. 3,000/-. It
ought soon to be self-supporting. Ne-arly Rs. 500 worth of stuff has
already been sold by the Ashram and many who have hitherto used
the shoddy mill-made stuff, whether foreign or home-made, are using
the durable Ashram-made cloth. This enterprise is expected in 10
years’ time to resuscitate hundreds of weavers who have for the
moment abandoned their trade in hopeless despair. The system of
education at present in vogue is, it is held, wholly unsuited to India’s
needs, is a bad copy of the western model and it has by reason of the
medium of in-struction being a foreign language sapped the energy
of the youths who have passed through our schools and colleges and
has prduced an army of clerks and office-seekers. It has dried up all
originality, impoverished the vernaculars and has deprived the masses
of the benefit of higher knowledge which would otherwise have
percolated to them through the intercourse of the educated classes
with them. The system has resulted in creating a gulf between
educated India and the masses. It has stimulated the brain but starved
the spirit for want of a religious basis for education and emaciated the
body for want of training of handicrafts. It has criminally neglected
the greatest need of India in that there is no agricultural training worth
the name provided in the course. The experiment now being carried
on at the Ashram seeks to avoid all t he defects above noted. The
medium of instruction is the provincial vernacular. Hindi is taught as a
common medium and handloom-weaving and agriculture are taught
from he very commencement. Pupils are taught to look up to these as
a means of livelihood and the knowledge of letters as a training for
the head and the heart and as a means of national service. The
curriculum has been mapped so as to cover all the essentials of the
graduate course in the existing institutions within a period of 13 years.
The experiment is in the hands of Professor Shah, late of the Gujarat
College. Mr. Shah was associated with Professor Gajjar for 10 years.
He is assisted by Mr. Narhari, B.A., LL.B., Mr. Fulchand Shah, B.A.,
Mr. Dattatreya Kalelkar, B.A., Mr. Chhaganlal Gandhi and Mr.
Kishorelal Mashruwala, B.A., LL.B. All but the last named have
pledged themselves exclusively to he work for life on a pittance
enough to support them and their families. Mr. Kishorelal has given

460

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

his services free for one year, having means of his own, and will if he
finds the work congenial at the end of the year cast in his lot with the
rest. The experiment is confined to about 12 lads including two girls
belonging to the Ashram or being children of the teachers. It is being
supervised by Professor Anandshankar Dhruva, Vice-Principal of the
Gujarat College. I build the highest hopes upon it. My faith in it is
unquenchable. It may fail but if it does, the fault must not be in the
system but with us the workers. If it succeeds, voluntary institutions
after its model can be multiplied and the Government called upon to
adopt it.
That Hindi ought at the earliest moment to displace English
seems to be a self-demonstrated proposition. Hindi can not only
become the common medium between the educated classes but it
opens the door to the hearts of the masses in a way which no other
vernacular does and English certainly never can. Madras alone
presents a difficulty but I have sufficient faith in the spirituality and
the imaginative faculty of the southerners to know that they will not
be long before they take up Hindi as the common medium. No
presidency in India has the same aptitude for learning languages that
Madras has. That is my South African experience. Although the
preponderating element there is Dravidian, the Tamils and the Telugus
picked up Hindi instead of the Hindustani- speaking races picking up
Tamil or Telugu.
It is then for these experiments that I ask for your pecuniary
support. I hope you will send me what you can, if you at all agree with
any of the activities. You may earmark your donation if you wish.
A trust will be created of the land and buildings. Accurate
account of the expenditure in the various branches is being kept and
an abstract will be rendered to the donors.
I do not want if I can help it as yet to make an appeal through
the Press. The activities have not advanced far enough to warrant such
an appeal. But I do not hesitate to approach with confidence those
who know me personally either to assist me themselves or advise their
friends to do so.
Yours sincerely,

M. K. GANDHI

377. LETTER TO PRIVATE SECRETARY TO VICEROY
BANKIPORE ,

July 7, 1917
DEAR MR. MAFFEY,

I am on my way to Ranchi in connection with the work of the
Champaran committee. I write this regarding the Annie Besant
agitation. As I am taking part in it by keeping myself in touch with
the leaders and pressing on their attention my views regarding it, 1 I
feel that I could not do so without His Excellency knowing the fact
and knowing also my position in the agitation.
In my humble opinion, the internments are a big blunder.
Madras was absolutely calm before then. Now it is badly disturbed.
India as a whole had not made common cause with Mrs. Besant but
now she is on a fair way towards commanding India’s identity with
her methods. Having had breathing time, I had gone down to
Ahmedabad for some work connected with the institution I am
conducting there, I passed through Bombay and Allahabad on my
return and I was able to gauge the situation. I myself do not like much
in Mrs. Besant’s method. I have not liked the idea of the political
propaganda being carried on during the War. In my opinion, our
restraint will have been the best propaganda. But the whole country
was against me. And no one could deny Mrs. Besant’s great sacrifice
and love for India or her desire to be strictly constitutional, nor could
the country’s right to carry on the propaganda be denied if it chose to
do so. Many of us have respectfully differed from Mrs. Besant but all
have recognised her powers and devotion. The Congress was trying to
‘capture’ Mrs. Besant. The latter was trying to ‘capture’ the former.
Now they have almost become one. I plead with all the earnestness I
can command for the boldest policy, i.e., to acknowledge the blunder
in the frankest manner and to withdraw the orders of internment and
to declare that the country has the right to carry on any propaganda
that is not subversive of the British Constitution and is totally free
from violence. Such an act will be a demonstration of strength, not of
weakness. Only a government having the desire always to do the right
and the power to crush the wrong can do it.

If unfortunately timid counsels prevail, there will be no rest in
the country and the cult of violence will surely spread. Open violence
one could understand and deal with. That may not be practised, but
secret violence would be attempted. No one would be or feel
responsible for it. Young minds without any lead from anybody in
particular are, I regretfully observe, drifting in that direction. My life
is dedicated to the preventing of the spread of the disease and its
uprooting in so far as it has gained a foothold. I have presented to the
youths and to Indians in general in my humble way a better and more
effective method and that is the method of soul force or truth force or
love force which for want of a better term I have described as passive
resistance. And I am asking the leaders to adopt this method fully and
boldly at this critical juncture. It involves self-suffering and that alone
throughout. No government in the world can afford continually to
imprison or molest innocent men; the British Government cannot
afford it. It is its great secret and character that even when it does
wrong, it seeks to justify it before the world on moral grounds.I think
I have sufficiently explained myself. I hope, I shall not be
misunderstood. I ask for forgiveness for the presumption in writing
this letter and earnestly pray for the acceptance of my proposal.
Please place this before His Excellency. If my presence is
required at Simla, I am at H.E.’s disposal.
Yours sincerely,

M. K. GANDHI

381. A FEW WORDS TO ORPHANAGES1
[Before July 11, 1917]
In the course of my travels in India, I have examined a number
of orphanages, some of them closely and others cursorily, and have
expressed my views on some of them before the managers. Like
anyone else, I also think well of my ideas and I feel that it will not be
amiss to place them before the public.
An anathashrama may be correctly defined as a place which
gives shelter to those who are anatha 2 and makes them sanatha3 . In
respect of such institutions, the term anatha is especially applied to
children who have no living parents or guardians. Their claim is, or
ought to be, to make good the want of a guardian. Anathashram is a
translation of the English term ‘orphanage’. Though this is the
meaning of the term anatha, besides children, young men who can
earn their livelihood are also accommodated in orphanages. In
addition, the disabled, the lame, the crippled and the blind are also
admitted and now even foundling-boxes have been introduced in
orphanages. It is my opinion that this way one of the purposes is
served fully. Though, superficially considered, it might suggest a
more philanthropic attitude, on deeper reflection it will be seen that
this state of affairs comes of a commercial mentality. I have no doubt
that the future of the orphanages is the same as that of misers who
would earn the highest interest on their moneys and so ultimately ruin
themselves. I have used the word ‘future’ only to be on the safe side.
Personally, I see their degradation in the present. An arrangement like
this is a sign of our fear, of our lack of faith. We assume that, for all
our institutions, we get help from the rich only with the utmost efforts.
“We cannot but protect the disabled and we are bound to take care of
babies born in secret; so let us manage that from whatever we have
received.” This is an abject attitude. I am convinced that for a good
cause money will be available even in this poor country of India. It is
for those in charge to prove that the cause is good. Institutions have

declined not for lack of funds but for lack of organizers with
steadfastness, faith and integrity. Whether or no this view is right, one
thing is certain, that, in trying to ride three horses at once the
orphanages succeed in managing none.
In these conditions, how can the ‘orphans’ cease to be
‘orphans’? They are constantly reminded of the fact of their being
such. We would never want to leave our children in charge of these
institutions. Here is the real test of an orphanage. We would not
welcome the companionship of the disabled, the blind, or the crippled
for our children. If these institutions were [really] the guardians of
those without any guardians, we would find the manager’s children
among the inmates. They would have no hesitation in placing their
children in the midst of the orphans, if for no other reason, at least in
order to test themselves. I submit, on the strength of my extensive
experience, that this is not too excessive an expectation. That the
orphans are placed with the disabled is not all; the other arrangements
also are mostly such that the children are constantly reminded of their
destitute condition. If orphanages were reserved for orphans alone,
they could be self-supporting in a very short time. We have much to
learn from the Salvation Army1 in this respect. The orphanages which
they run have a soul in them. Ours are by comparison soulless. They
have given refuge to thousands of children, have made men of them,
have found employment for them. The children in our orphanages
have not been given this sense of security. Some have been found
petty jobs. These may be left out of account. The general practice in
our orphanages is to send away the children when they come of age.
Not so with the Salvation Army. In its institutions the orphans, when
they come of age, start working in its factories, in the same way that a
son in the family who has grown up is regarded as an additional shield
and support for the family. It is necessary that such a family feeling
be injected in our institutions too.
We can educate them in the institutions and find work for them
in the factories of the institutions even as we provide them with
lodging, boarding and clothing. We can launch great national
experiments in the institutions, can impart education on national lines,
teach them crafts, teach them agriculture, and save the professions
which are dying out. If affairs are managed in this manner, the

orphans of today can become teachers, artisans, and leaders in their
own orphanages. We can also raise an Indian Defence Force suited to
our conditions from among the inmates of such orphanages.
If I am right in these calculations, a common standard can be set
up for all the institutions by bringing together the heads of all the
institutions, or at least of those in the Bombay Province, and
consulting their views. If there is a central executive body for all, it
can supervise them and make such changes as are called for by
experience. If we are not ready for such an integrated scheme, a
policy like the one indicated above can surely be introduced in those
institutions which have more of life in them.
In some institutions, I noted a tendency to coax children into
staying on there. To me this seems to be an ill-considered thing to do.
The boys who do not want to continue in the orphanages are not
orphans but free persons [who can look after themselves]. The worth
of an orphanage should not be judged by the number of inmates, but
rather by the number of citizens it turns out.
There are enough institutions to meet the needs of the disabled.
That, wherever necessary, such institutions should be set up separately,
requires no elaborate proof.
The problem of admitting foundlings is a serious one. I am not
yet convinced that providing for such admissions is ethically sound. I
have a kind of feeling that such facilities lead to increase in
indulgence. It can in no way be proved that keeping alive every
creature that is born, no matter how, is a part of humanitarianism. It is
indeed futile to make such an effort. One detects a hidden pride
behind it. I, for one, realize every moment from experience that the
term ‘humanitarianism’ is not easy to understand. I have in some
measure made that subject my own and hence I have ventured to be so
emphatic. Humanitarianism does not mean saving a definite number
of lives. It is the very property of the soul. Because of this fact, living
creatures in the presence of a compassionate soul have an immediate
and direct experience of its compassion. There is no room for
arithmetic in humanitarianism. Unclean flour is infested with
numberless lives. To preserve such flour is no humanitarianism. It lies
rather in covering up the flour with earth or destroying it, though
either way the vermin in the flour perish. Numberless vermin perish
even in the process of keeping our bodies clean. Pure
humanitarianism will seek ways to prevent the infesting of the flour
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

469

and keeping the body from becoming unclean. So also, pure
humanitarianism will look for the cause of surreptitious admissions
and take measures to promote moral purity. It will not encourage and
shield laxity by accepting the burden of such admissions.
I need hardly say that my criticism is only meant to be helpful
and is not prompted by a desire to cast aspersions. It is also not true
that all the comments apply to every institution. The sole purpose of
this article is to see that all the institutions attain the highest possible
level.
In almost all our institutions, we notice more of the attitude of
the vanik1 than anything else. It is imperative to keep this in the
background and give prominence to the (venturesome) spirit of the
Kshatriya, to the (far-sighted) vision of the Brahmin, above all, to the
Sudra’s spirit (of service).

382. LETTER TO ESTHER FAERING
MOTIHARI,

July 14, 1917
MY DEAR ESTHER,

I have just returned from Ranchi to find your letter awaiting me.
You never told me you had taken to vegetarianism. I am sure it
is the proper thing for this climate, apart from its religious value. A
convert to vegetarianism is often told to eat of pulses, butter, cheese
and milk more than during the meat-eating period. This is a mistake.
Pulses may be eaten only sparingly. If one takes a fair quantity of
milk, very little butter is required.
In my opinion, it is wrong to possess unnecessary things; they
presuppose defence of things possessed against those who may covet
them. They require care and attention which might well be devoted to
more important matters and loss of them always leaves a pang, no
matter how detached you may feel about them.
The sittings of the Committee commence on Monday.

Have it made into pieces and state the price per yard; you will
also do well to attach [price-]slips with gum. Dhotis are needed, as
many as you can send, 10 yards by 50 inches and 10 yards by 45
inches. Napkins and handkerchiefs too are needed. Also some kind of
cloth for scarves. And caps as well. Can’t the women living there be
asked to work on these? They may be paid a small amount. The caps
must be hand-stitched, even if they cost more. Did you get my letter1
about Santok? It has not been acknowledged. Tell Fulchand not to
send me the accounts every week. It will be enough if he sends, from
time to time, items of special note.
1. How much Hindi, and how well, is the Swamiji able to
teach?
2. How many turn up to learn it?
3. Have you opened a class in the city?
4. Has Anandshankarbhai turned up again, as he was to? Has
he started teaching?
5. What came out of the proposal to buy new land?
6. Has it been possible for Chhotalal to be completely free
from cooking?
Either you or Fulchand may please answer these questions.

384. SPEECH AT CHAMPARAN ENQUIRY COMMITTEE
MEETING
BETTIAH,

July 19, 1917
The Champaran Agrarian Enquiry Committee resumed their sitting today. At
the outset the Chairman1 said some of the written statements put before them
contained events relating to specific acts of coercion alleged to have occurred many
years ago. Some were about twenty or twenty-five years old. It was quite impossible
for them for their inquiry to extend back to such remote periods. Their inquiry related
to the present agrarian conditions of Champaran District and their concern with the
past history would be inasmuch as it would elucidate present conditions. He did not
think any advantage would accrue by inquiring into individual cases that occurred a
long number of years ago and he ruled the Committee should confine itself to more
recent events for the reason that there was a special inquiry made by Mr. Gourlay in
1909 which dealt with all agrarian conditions prior to that date and he proposed the
Committee should undertake only an inquiry of conditions after Mr. Gourlay’s
inquiry. That seemed to him to be the reasonable time to adopt. The second point he
wished to put forward was that certain incidents referred to matters which had been the
subject of decisions of judicial courts of the country. Again, it would be useless for
them to attempt to review those cases. Already those cases had been heard and decided
by judicial courts and it was not in the province of the Committee to revise the
decisions of the judicial courts of the country. Therefore, so far as those cases were
concerned, all that they could consider was the judicial record and not any extra facts
connected with it.
Mr. Gandhi said he wished to say just a few words on the subject as he was
responsible for putting in those statements. He bowed to the Chairman’s ruling but
he thought it was necessary to put those matters in statement as otherwise he would
not have done justice to those men unless he allowed them to give their story in its
historical sequence. He did not wish the Committee to go behind judicial decisions,
but he thought the Committee should have an opportunity of having the full story of
the ryots.
The Chairman said they could not enquire into allegations that judgements of
courts were based on false facts.
Mr. Gandhi said he agreed, but he thought it was proper not to withhold
anything from the Committee.

Mr. Gandhi, who questioned witness [Mr. A. Ammon ], said the case about
Sant Raut was not that his house was looted, but that when he returned in January he
found his field granaries, grain, utensils, sal tree logs, etc. looted.
Witness replied that it was not true, so far as he knew. He did not know that
Sant had filed a petition a few days before the alleged occurrence before the magistrate
saying he was in fear of these things being looted. He heard of the loot for the first
time from the newspapers. . . .

RANGOON
SIR,

I have the honour to submit the enclosed note on the matter
before your Committee for its consideration.

Yours faithfully,

[ENCLOSURE]
NOTE
PART I

GRIEVANCES

The undersigned has considerable experience of travelling,
having travelled in several parts of the world during the past 25 years.
The undersigned had occasion during 19011 and again in 1915 2
to travel to Burma. The undersigned used to travel, as a rule, first class
up to nearly 4 years ago. Latterly he has travelled as a deck passenger.
In the opinion of the undersigned:
1. Deck passengers making use of the British India Steam
Navigation Service do not receive adequate attention from the
Company’s employees or the police.
2. The passengers are hustled about by both, are spoken to
roughly, often sworn at and not unoften assaulted.
3. The employees do not put themselves out for receiving
complaints.
4. The crew maltreat the passengers and almost invariably take

bribes.
5. Passengers are huddled together anyhow, there being absolutely
no supervision as to how and where they seat themselves; the
result is that the strongest or the richest secure the best
accommodation.
6. Female passengers are similarly treated as in clause (5) and have
no privacy of any kind reserved for them.
7. The deck is often in a filthy condition.
8. There is no control over the passengers’ behaviour; the result is
that dirty passengers spit and eat anywhere and anyhow, much
to the discomfort of the cleanly ones.
9. Closets are filthy beyond description; closets allotted for females
are often used by men; Mrs. Gandhi had to be specially
accompanied each time she wanted to use the closets. There
are, as a rule, no locks to the doors.
10. Bathing accommodation, such as it is, is often taken up by the
crew. There is hardly any facility for washing clothes.
11. Accommodation referred to in (9) and (10) is too little for the
number of passengers taken.
12. During his voyages, the undersigned felt that the passengers
taken were too many for the space reserved for deck
passengers.
13. There seemed to be no control over the disposition of the
luggage of the passengers; the result was that much space was
taken up by the passengers’ luggage.
14. The undersigned found that through ignorance, fear, laziness
and such other causes, passengers seemed to be reluctant to
make complaints.
R EMEDIES
PART II

In the opinion of the undersigned:
1. There should be special, trusted representatives of the Company
approved by the Government who would go out of their way to
understand deck passengers and their grievances.
2. For the wharves assistance of trustworthy volunteers should be
sought from known organisations conducted in the interest of
the passengers.
3. Deck, closet and bathing accommodation should be increased.
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

4. The representatives mentioned in clause (1) of Part II should
inspect every ship and satisfy themselves as to [clause] (3) [of]
Part II.
5. The representatives aforesaid should meet every steamer and
inquire of the passengers as to their experiences.
6. Medical Officer on board should be empowered and be
expected to look after the physical comforts of the passengers in
every way. The undersigned was told by a medical officer that
the looking after the accomodation of passengers, their
cleanliness, the closet arrangement, their condition did not fall
within his province.
7. An instruction book in several vernaculars should be issued for
the passengers and a copy handed to each passenger on his
receiving his ticket.
Should the Committee desire further information from the
undersigned, he will gladly endeavour to give it.

DEAR SHANKERLAL AND JAMNADAS,

I have already replied to the telegrams from both of you.
Except for going there, I have done everything I could. And I would
have gone if it had at all been possible. The Champaran Committee
has been working without interruption. Its tenure is for three months.
The time limit has been set by me. How can I ask it to suspend its
functioning for a week? And how can I remain absent? If this task is
accomplished you can take it that it will be a great step forward
towards swaraj. I must not harm it in any way.
However, I am sure that if all of you remain firm on the path of
truth, nothing will go wrong there either. I am prepared to fight by
your side even in the face of the opposition from the whole country. I
do not have the strength to handle the work single-handed. After
settling the affairs there, both or either one of you should come over
if possible. More I shall explain. I wish you would come.

390. QUESTIONS DURING EVIDENCE BEFORE
CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE 1
MOTIHARI,

July 26, 1917
The only witness examined today by the Champaran Agrarian Enquiry
Committee was Mr. W. S. Irwin, Manager of Motihari Limited. Examined by the
Chairman, witness said his concern consisted of six factories. It was an indigo
concern before, but it was not now. He converted the tinkathia system in 1911 by
taking their tawan of sharahbeshi. Under the tinkathia obligation every ryot had to
work three cottahs 2 of indigo. The claim was against every ryot. Witness had taken
sharahbeshi in mukarrari villages and tawan in thikadari villages.
Asked whether he claimed that an exclusive right was created because the Raj
had allowed it, witness said that the Raj had taken a good deal more than they were
allowed to collect under the terms of their leases. When he said Government
recognised the obligation he meant that they recognised it tacitly, because they said
that so long as indigo was grown rents could not be raised.
Witness then gave similar evidence to the previous witnesses about the
imposition of fines and employment of labour.
To Mr. Gandhi, witness said he had not fined any person Rs. 500/- when told
that Mr. Gandhi had a man who alleged witness had fined him a thousand rupees.
Witness said:
“If Mr. Gandhi were to remain in this part of the country for the length of time
I have (and it is 35 years), he would be convinced what a consummate liar the
Champaran ryot is.” There were several good qualities in the Champaran ryot, but
certainly truth was not one of them. Before his letter to The Pioneer, there was not a
single complaint made against him.
Mr. Gandhi said that from Mr. Heycock’s (Collector’s) summary, it appeared
during the last four years, 27 petitions had been sent to the Collector from 20
different villages against the factory.
Witness said he had thirty thousand tenants, and if in four years 27 petitions
were sent, it was natural they might not come to his notice.
Witness was next questioned about specific cases of oppression and in one it
was alleged he had destroyed the crop of one Lakhan Rai.3

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Witness said that in November 1914 at a court auction sale he had purchased a
certain plot of one Alam. A portion of the holding was in Lakhan Rai’s name as a
sub-ryot, but at the attestation Lakhan Rai told the SettlementOfficer he was no
longer a sub-ryot. Witness here produced a certified copy to substantiate his
statement and aid that at the time there was a crop of oats on the land and he let
Lakhan Rai have half of it. In May last he ordered the whole of this land to be
prepared for indigo and it was then discovered that in two cottahs in a corner Lakhan
Rai had surreptitiously sown china. This he had absolutely no right to do, and
witness’ man ploughed up the whole land. The crop was of wry poor quality and the
damage was very slight.
With regard to a second incident about which he was asked, witness admitted
that to a certain extent he was in the wrong. The story relating to this incident, he
said, was that about the 23rd May last his Gumashta1 reported to him that three
factory carts had gone to complainant’s village to bring the factory’s half share of
batai bhusa. There at the instigation of Bataidar, his cartmen assaulted and the bhusa
was thrown from the carts. When the men went to witness he admitted he gave them a
few cuts on the leg with a light riding cane, but he was very angry at the time. They
had assaulted his men badly. It was true he had threatened to fine them, but he had not
actually done so. As for their being shut up in witness’s hen house, it was absolutely
fasle. The men were nowhere near it.
MR. GANDHI :

Then half of the ryot’s story is true?

It was true he had converted some of the ryots’ lands into zirat lands, but he
had given lands in exchange and there was no complaint about it. On the exchange
lands, the ryots had actually sown and reaped their crops. Witness had to convert
these lands, as it was necessary to have all zirat lands in one place to ensure effective
supervision. It was the practice in all zamindaris to effect this exchange of lands.
This concluded witness’s evidence and the Committee shortly after left for
Bettiah to go to villages in the interior where they intend to have local inspection.

POUNDS—Mr. Gandhi considered that pounds should be directly managed by
the Board and not auctioned. . . .
(1) Cost of Cultivation:—Mr. Reid said it cost planters Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per
acre for zirat cultivation. Raja Kirtyanand Sinha 1 confirmed this from
his own experience. Mr. Gandhi said that raiyats estimated it not below
Rs. 20 or Rs. 25 per acre, but he would examine the question further
after seeing the factory book. . . .
. . . Mr. Gandhi urged that voluntary contracts should be limited to one
year. . . .
SHARAHBESHI —As regards enhancement of rent in lieu of tinkathia
(sharahbeshi) recognized at the resettlement, Mr. Gandhi thought that it ought to be
revised and reduced to the ordinary enhancement allowed for rise in prices. The
President and other members were not prepared to agree and it was pointed out that
under the law the enhancement could not be touched in most cases.
TAWAN —All agreed that tawan was an unjustifiable practice and should be
stopped for the future. The question was then discussed as to what action, if any,
should be taken in cases where it had already been taken. Mr. Gandhi thought that
where sums had already been paid, no action could be taken, but that factories should
be required to cancel all outstanding debts on this account. He recognized that this
could only be applied to factories which were still the property of the persons who
had taken the bonds and had not been sold in the meantime. This could be enforced by
the Court of Wards refusing to renew the leases of thikadars 2 who refused to agree to
this arrangement. Other members felt that there were difficulties in the proposal
which required further consideration.

393. CONFIDENTIAL NOTE TO CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE
MEMBERS ON SHARAHBESHI
BETTIAH,

July 29, 1917
In my humble opinion (1) the existence of the committee is
due to the evils of the tinkathia system; (2) its chief function is to
deal with it in an equitable manner; and (3) it is expected to make
such recommendations as would settle the matter once for all, would
restore harmony between zamindars or thikadars and the raiyats
andwould prevent future disputes whether in the shape of law suits or
otherwise.
If tinkathia is abolished for a consideration, the committee will
have neglected its primary duty. The committee has been appointed in
spite of the tinkathia system being the subject-matter of a law suit.
The committee has overwhelming proof before it to know that
tinkathia has bound the raiyat like the coil of a serpent from which
whether it be legal or not the raiyats have ever striven to get free and
from which the Government have hitherto made unsuccessful attempts
to free them. Official evidence before us goes to show that it has taxed
the officials’ wit to the utmost in their endeavour to get out of it; they
attribute everything to tinkathia. There is much truth in Mr. Whitty’s
remark that though he can produce no direct evidence to show that
tinkathia is responsible for the abwabs, etc., he has felt it to be so. In
the circumstances the committee, I venture to submit, is bound to
condemn it in unequivocal terms and advise its abolition without any
consideration whatsoever being paid by the raiyats. The legality of
slavery, when once its sinfulness was recognized, did not require a
price from the slave for his freedom.
It is submitted therefore that the least the committee can do is:
(1) to abolish tinkathia unconditionally;
(2) to abolish sharahbeshi without interference with the past
collections at the sharahbeshi rates;
(3) to cancel sharahbeshi whether registered as a matter of
contract or compromise subject however to enhancement
of the pre-sharahbeshi rent as in kham1 or thika villages.

482

An estate under direct management

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

The result of such a settlement will mean withdrawal of the High
Court case and lasting peace so far as tinkathia and sharahbeshi are
concerned.
The result of leaving the matter to be decided as a matter of law
pure and simple will be a fruitful source of interminable disputes in
which the longest purse alone must win. It will promote bitterness
between parties and reopening of many cases in the event of the
raiyats winning, decided under the Sweeney1 Settlement and will mean
a loss to the landlord of the enhancement offered under the foregoing
scheme. Neither the Government nor the committee can contemplate
with equanimity such a state of things. Finally, if tawan is bad,
sharahbeshi is worse from the raiyats’ standpoint. The former has
pinched the present party, the latter leaves a legacy to generations yet
unborn. We know too that sharahbeshi was proposed and taken when
indigo was no longer a profitable proposition for the planter and that
the Rajpur concern has shown that khuski indigo has been taken up
practically without any extra cost to the planter. So with sharahbeshi
he has a fair prospect of having obtained the utmost enhancement in
his rents and a continuance of profits from indigo under another
form.

395. LETTER TO ESTHER FAERING
NADIAD,

August 3, 1917
MY DEAR ESTHER,

You have raised big questions. I think the command of Jesus is
unequivocal. All killing is bad for one who is filled with love. He will
not need to kill. He will not kill. He who is filled with pity for the
snake and does not fear him will not kill him and the snake will not
hurt him. This state of innocence is the one we must reach. But only a
few can reach it. It seems to me to be impossible for nations to reach
it. Equal progress in all is an inconceivable situation. Nations will
therefore always fight. One of them will be less wrong than the other.
A nation to be in the right can only fight with soul-force. Such a
nation has still to be born. I had hoped that India was that nation. I
fear I was wrong. The utmost I expect of India is that she may become
a great restraining force. But she must acquire the ability to fight and
suffer before she can speak to the world with any degree of effect.The
pertinent question for you and me is what is our duty as individuals. I
have come to this workable decision for myself, ‘I will not kill anyone
for any cause whatsoever but be killed by him if resistance or his will
render my being killed necessary.’ I would give similar advice to
everybody. But where I know that there is want of will altogether, I
would advise him to exert his will and fight. There is no love where
there is no will. In India there is not only no love but hatred due to
emasculation. There is the strongest desire to fight and kill side by
side with utter helplessness. This desire must be satisfied by restoring
the capacity for fighting. Then comes the choice.
Yes, the very act of forgiving and loving shows superiority in
the doer. But that way of putting the proposition begs the question,
who can love? A mouse as mouse cannot love a cat. A mouse cannot
484

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

be commonly said to refrain from hurting a cat. You do not love him
whom you fear. Immediately you cease to fear, you are ready for
your choice—to strike or to refrain. To refrain is proof of awakening
of the soul in man; to strike is proof of body-force. The ability to
strike must be present when the power of the soul is demonstrated.
This does not mean that we must be bodily superior to the adversary.
This is not a satisfactory letter but I think you will follow my
argument. But in matters such, as these, prayer is the thing.
With love,

said that, in his opinion, to adopt Mr. Gandhi’s suggestion that in all such cases the
matter should go to a court would be injurious to the raiyats and would moreover
require legislation. He thought Mr. Gandhi’s objection might be met if it were clearly
laid down and understood—
(1) that the payment was entirely voluntary,
(2) that if the raiyat thought he was not liable, or that the payment was
excessive, it was open for him to refuse to pay.
. . . Mr. Gandhi said that as the fines were few, so also would be the number of
cases in which the landlords would have to report to the court. He thought the power
of the landlord over the raiyats was so great that it would be difficult to ensure that
payments were voluntary. After some discussion it was agreed, on the suggestion of
Mr. Reid, that the assessing of damages should be left to arbitration....

the family. These tides and ebbs scarcely affect me either. This is the
third death in the family I have heard of in recent days. I think for a
moment and then the thing goes out of my mind. This condition has
come to me with no effort on my part but I feel it is worth while
cultivating it. Death is but an inevitable transformation of the present
state. Why should it occasion fear? Birth is also a sign of the same
process of change. Why do we hail it with joy? The aspiration for
deliverance from both the contingencies, for us as well as for the
whole world, is described as supreme purushartha1 , Such being the
case, what consolation shall I give to Anand? She is given to religious

(1) Cost of Cultivation : —Mr. Gandhi said that he had not yet got certain
figures from Mr. Jameson 2 but subject to anything new that these
might disclose, it was recorded as the conclusion of the Committee that
the maximum cost was Rs. 15 per bigha (8_ hath laggi 3 ) or Rs. 10 an
acre.

(2) Mr. Gandhi said the cost of seed of country crops was small but the
President remarked that for rabi 4 crops, it was a considerable item. . . .
Khuski Indigo—Mr. Gandhi suggested that a minimum rate should be fixed for
khuski indigo. Mr. Reid thought that there might be a danger of this suggestion
extending to other crops, e.g., sugarcane. After discussion it was agreed that during
the transition stage in view of the past history of indigo, it was desirable that the
Association, with the approval of the Commissioner, should fix a minimum rate for
khuski indigo, the transition stage being considered to last until Government was
satisfied that the raiyats knew that they need not grow indigo unless they liked.

Compensation for abolition of tinkathia—The next point for discussion was
whether on abolition of the system, compensation was to be allowed in case where
the growing of indigo was recorded as an incident of the tenancy. The President, in
putting his view before the Committee, said he was anxious to remove anything
unjust to the raiyats. . . . He thought that perhaps Mr. Gandhi from his experience of a

raiyatwari tract had not fully appreciated the landlord’s position. The proposal he put
before the meeting was that a special court should be created to deal with these cases.
This court would decide, subject to appeal to a special judge,
(a) if the incident of tenancy existed, and if so
(b) a fair rate for commutation of the incident.
The commutation should be made by an addition to rent and not by a lump sum.
In fixing a fair rent as commutation, the court should
(a) consider the loss incurred by the raiyat under tinkathia
(b) the actual enhanced rents paid in similar circumstances for commutation,
and
(c) in no circumstances fix a total rent which was not fair and equitable
The enhancement might be made progressive if it exceeded 25 per cent.
Mr. Gandhi said he did not wish to enter into legal points but merely to regard
the question from the point of view of equity. The result of the proposal would be that
raiyats in villages under direct management would be placed in a better position than
raiyats in indigo villages, although the latter had borne this heavy burden in the past
which was inequitable. He thought that the evil of the system had not been properly
recognised by the Committee. Government had never agreed that indigo-growing was
an obligation, and all the papers showed that the system and its accompaniments
formed an intolerable burden on the raiyats. The proposal did not free the raiyats; on
the other hand, it was a free gift to the planters, it was the planters who wished to
give up indigo because, whatever might be the case now, indigo was not paying when
the conversions were made, and it was not fair to the raiyats to make them pay for
giving up indigo. He had considered the matter from the landlords’ point of view, as
was shown by his agreement in the matter of tawan. In the present question, he could
not separate the raiyats of mukarrari villages from those of thika villages. They
were in the same position and should be regarded in the same way. He could not
therefore agree to anything beyond an enhancement of rent under the ordinary
provision of the law, and opposed any special enhancement in lieu of tinkathia. He
foresaw complications in the action proposed. A settlement by a special court would
take some months, which was undesirable in the present state of unrest. An immediate
and automatic remedy was required, and this would be the merit of his suggestion of an
enhancement at a fixed rate on the ground of the rise in prices, that is, of 3 annas in
the rupee all round. . . .
The President pointed out that in comparing the position of the nonindigo raiyats with the indigo raiyats, it had to be considered that in villages
where abwab were taken, they were higher than sharahbeshi, and, that where
abwab were not taken (e.g., Madhuban Estate), the rent was enhanced to a

488

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

higher pitch than elsewhere. Admittedly in Bettiah kham villages

these

considerations did not apply but it was impossible to secure absolute equality, and in
any case the proposal would improve the position of the raiyat who had been
growing indigo. As to the criticism that the proposal was a free gift to planters, he
said that it was only proposed to allow an enhancement where the legal property of
the planter existed and even then the full value of this property was not being
given. He did not think the difficulties of the special court would be great. The
settlement records would give a good basis and the area to be dealt with was not large.
. . . Mr. Rainy1 said the proposal was similar to that adopted in Chhota Nagpur
where legislation compelled the computation of predial conditions. He denied that
Government had never recognised the fact that the obligation might be an incident of
tenancy, for section 29 proviso (iii) was clear evidence that they had and so was the
Board’s letter No. 5032-R(A) dated the 16th October, 1912, regarding Mr. Irwin’s
sharahbeshi. Mr. Gandhi said that if the legal right was not consistent with equity or
had been grossly abused as in this case, no compensation should be given. . . .
Mr. Reid said that most of the raiyats took their holdings under an agreement
to grow indigo. Mr. Gandhi said the complaint was not against indigo itself but
against the manner and method of growing it. . . . the complaint was not against the
system but against the moral and intellectual damage caused by it to the raiyats by
keeping them backward. The President pointed out that his proposal gave much to the
raiyats, viz., freedom
(1) from growing indigo if they did not wish,
(2) from having their best lands selected for indigo,
(3) from supervision by factory servants,
(4) from paying compensation for this freedom except in cases where the
obligation was the legal property of the landlord and even then full
compensation would not be given.
Mr. Gandhi said that this included nothing that was not offered by the planters
themselves but Mr. Rainy pointed out that whereas the planters offered their own
terms, the proposal contemplated that they should be compelled to accept terms fixed
by a court.
The President said that Mr. Gandhi’s position practically amounted to the
proposition that the raiyats should get off paying an equitable rent on the ground of
past oppression, which position did not appear to him to be sound.
At this stage, the meeting adjourned.

COMMITTEE MEETING
August 11, 1917
Resuming the discussion of the previous day, Mr. Gandhi said that the average
amount of sharahbeshi taken was about 50 per cent of the rent. The note circulated by
Raja Kirtyanand Sinha suggested a compromise of an enhancement of four annas in
the rupee to cover sharahbeshi and ordinary enhancement on the score of rise in
prices. He was anxious to meet the views of his fellow-members so far as that was
possible, and he was prepared to agree to a small enhancement over and above that
admissible for a rise in prices but would not support a penal enhancement. The
greatest difficulty would be as regards the sharahbeshi already taken. He thought that
anything very much larger than the enhancement allowed for the rise in prices would
be near the danger point. . . . The President said that he understood the proposal to be
that, in cases where the obligation to grow indigo existed as an incident of tenancy or
had been commuted by sharahbeshi, a slight enhancement though not a penal one in
excess of the enhancement generally admissible for a rise in prices should be allowed.
He pointed out that it was impossible to fix a definite figure for the total
enhancement, because it was still uncertain what enhancement would eventually be
allowed by the courts on account of the rise in prices. The proposal therefore could
only refer to the amount of enhancement above this figure. He asked Mr. Gandhi to
what extra enhancement he was prepared to agree. Mr. Gandhi said he thought not
more than one anna in the rupee.
. . The President said that the facts were that by a settlement between the
planters and raiyats, there had been a sharahbeshi enhancement of 50 per cent, which
Mr. Gandhi thought excessive because the legal property in exchange for which this
enhancement was taken was inequitable and therefore the enhancement should be
reduced. Mr. Gandhi added that there was also the fact that the tenants were not paying
rents and in one case their resistance had been successful. By adopting his
suggestion, the Committee would put a stop at once to the present trouble and it was
not open to the Committee to shift responsibility by suggesting another tribunal.
Mr. Adami held the view that one anna was not sufficient and, considering the
difficulties which had been pointed out by Mr. Rainy, he would be inclined to adopt
the suggestion of a general settlement of rents in mukarrari villages by a special
tribunal in all cases where the obligation still existed or where it had been converted.
Raja Kirtyanand Sinha supported the proposal in his note for an enhancement of four
annas in the rupee. Mr. Gandhi remarked that if Mr. Adami’s proposal was accepted,
the Committee would only have half done its work, but his main objection to it was

490

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

that it would add to a ferment which already existed. The Committee had the right to
confer with the planters and he thought it would be far better if they could come to
some agreement with the planters without the necessity of appointing any tribunal
which would delay a final agreement. Mr. Reid pointed out that the three concerns
mainly affected were Motihari, Pipra and Turkaulia and he was prepared to put the
proposal before these three concerns. The President remarked that it should first be
decided whether the proposal was to be put before the planters as a final one which
they could adopt or not or merely as a basis for discussion. He inclined to the latter.
There was a tremendous advantage in getting the question settled without reference to
any court and, as he himself doubted whether one anna was adequate, he thought the
suggestion should be used as a basis for discussion. Mr. Gandhi said that he would not
go so far as to say that he could not agree to anything above one anna, but at the same
time he could not say that he would go beyond this point. The one anna was pure
concession on his part, because he did not think the raiyats should be called upon to
pay any enhancement beyond that allowed by the rise in prices. Mr. Reid doubted if
the planters would agree to anything under eight annas enhancement and pointed out
that even in Pipra which had taken the biggest enhancement, the rents were only Rs.
2 an acre.
Mr. Reid then suggested that it would be a fairer proposal if the amount of
sharahbeshi was reduced by a fixed percentage, say, by 25 per cent. Mr. Gandhi said
he would be very willing to consider that as a basis for a settlement and would be
prepared to go a long way to get good will established. It was generally agreed that
this was a fairer basis for discussion than the original proposal, and that Messrs
Irwin 1 , Hill2 , and Norman 3 should be asked to come on the following day in order that
the proposal might be put to them.
Tawan—The proposal left over for decision from the first meeting was
that no action should be taken in cases where tawan had been already paid but
that outstanding bonds on account of tawan should be cancelled. The President said
one difficulty about this proposal was that some bonds were mixed and included
amounts taken on accounts other than tawan, and some sort of enquiry would therefore
be necessary before the question of these bonds could be finally disposed of. The
other difficulty was that the proposal worked unequally both on raiyats
and planters. Mr. Gandhi pointed out that the first difficulty could be got over
by examining the factory books, and he would leave it to the Bettiah Raj to satisfy
itself that outstanding amounts on account of tawan had been foregone. Mr. Reid
said that he thought the only factory where such mixed bonds were taken was

Bairia where in some cases the debts of raiyats had been taken over and added to the
tawan. He would be inclined to apply the same suggestion to tawan that he made in
the case of sharahbeshi, namely, to deduct a percentage from outstandings and to
refund a percentage on the tawan already paid. This would only apply to thika
villages. . . .
The next point considered was whether the Raj could claim an enhancement
of rent in cases where tawan had been taken. Mr. Rainy said he was inclined to agree
to the proposal that no enhancement should be applied for in such cases, but the
President felt that the interests of the Bettiah Raj also needed consideration. He would
propose that the Raj should not be debarred from claiming an enhancement of rent in
cases where tawan had been taken but that for a period of years, say five, the enhanced
rent should not be realized. Mr. Gandhi suggested that the enhancement of rent should
be foregone until the following settlement. Mr. Rainy remarked that the 15-year
period could not be justified if the amount of tawan taken did not cover 15 times the
enhancement. His idea was that the Raj should forego enhancement so far as it was
covered by the tawan. Mr. Reid pointed out that the Raj was to blame to some extent
for the position. After discussion, it was decided to recommend that in cases where
tawan had been taken, the Raj was not to be debarred from claiming enhancement but
it would forego realisation of the enhancement for a period of seven years. . . .

Mr. Gandhi made the following proposals:
(1) That the Committee should make a general recommendation that the orders passed
by Government on the Committee’s report should be communicated in the vernacular
to the raiyats. This was accepted.
(2) That the kerosene oil monopoly should be stopped. This was agreed to.
(3) He proposed that raiyats should be informed that dasturi was illegal. It was agreed
to say in the report that it had been brought to notice that amla took commissions on
payments which were entirely illegal and that every effort should be made to stop
them and to recommend that a proclamation should be issued to the raiyats,
informing them that this dasturi was not legally payable.
(4) He suggested that some officer should be deputed to enquire periodically if the
orders of Government on the Committee’s recommendations were being carried out. It
was agreed that a paragraph should be included to emphasise that an important part of
the duties of the district staff would be to see that Government orders on the
recommendation were carried out which would apply especially to the staff of the
Bettiah Raj until Government was satisfied that the full effect of these orders had been
secured. . .

401. EXTRACTS FROM MINUTES OF CHAMPARAN
COMMITTEE MEETING
August 12, 1917
At the resumption of the discussion, Messrs Irwin (Motihari), Norman (Pipra)
and Hill (Turkaulia) were present by invitation. The President explained that this
discussion must be entirely confidential. The Committee had come to the unanimous
conclusion that the tinkathia system should go and should be replaced by the khuski
system under short-term agreement. It had, therefore, been necessary to consider the
question of the commutation of the indigo obligation both in cases where it still
existed and in cases where it had already been commuted . . . . Mr. Gandhi had said that
he was prepared to consider the possibility of a settlement on certain lines. He,
therefore, asked Mr. Gandhi to put his proposal before the planters present. Mr.
Gandhi said that his object was to promote harmony; he had no doubt that
sharahbeshi had caused considerable difficulty to the raiyats, seeing the large
numbers that had protested against it. At the time of conversion of the obligation,
indigo was not profitable and it was mutually beneficial to both parties to cancel the
obligation. Any burden imposed; therefore, on the raiyats beyond the ordinary legal
enhancements was one against which they were justified in protesting. As to the
amount of the ordinary enhancement about which on the previous day there appeared
to be some doubt, he referred to the judgment of the special judge in special appeal
No. 14 of 1916, and said that it appeared from that that the enhancement eventually
decided on would be three annas and not four annas eight pies. He had suggested as a
concession an extra anna on account of sharahbeshi. The planter would no doubt
consider that it called for considerable self-denia1 on their part to give up anything of
the sharahbeshi which they had already obtained, but he appealed to them to think of
the raiyats’ position; he would be prepared to accept a proposal on the basis of an
all-round reduction in the sharahbeshi already taken which was perhaps a better basis
for discussion. He pointed out how desirable it was that some figure should be agreed
upon between the parties because, in the event of this not being done either of the
ways suggested, the only course remaining was the settlement of rents by a special
tribunal which would give rise to endless quarrels, and would postpone settlement of
the disputes over a considerable period. If, however, the planters would prefer to have
a special tribunal, he would be prepared to consider the proposal. The President
remarked that so far as the discussion had gone, the Committee favoured a settlement
on the lines of proportionate reduction of sharahbeshi taken rather than the proposal
to an all-round enhancement of a certain amount on the original rents, because the
former was more equitable table in view of the varying conditions of different
concerns. . . . Mr. Reid said he had a long talk that morning with the three planters
present. At first they had been averse from agreeing to any decrease to the

493

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

enhancement which had been mutually agreed upon and approved by the Settlement
Court. Their view was that they had valuable property which the Committee was
asking them to give up in part. He had put the view to them that it was extremely
desirable to avoid future litigation and t rouble even if it involved some sacrifice on
their part. Finally, they had agreed reluctantly to remit a certain proportion. Mr. Hill,
however, had pointed out that his enhancements were low and that he thought that the
reduction in his case should be less than in that of others. Mr. Gandhi said he was
prepared to accept the principle of a different rate of reduction for different concerns
but the difficulty was that the Committee had not got the figures before them and he
doubted if the settlement records would give them sufficient data for arriving at a
proper variation in the reduction without further enquiry. The President said that the
advantage of getting a settlement by agreement was immense not only to the planters
but also to the raiyats . . . . If the Committee could decide on a particular percentage of
reduction, they would get a long way towards settlement and he, therefore, thought
that an endeavour should be made to get down to a particular figure. The alternative to
a settlement by agreement was one which would lead to increased bitterness of feeling
and even then the decisions of the special court might not be accepted with good-will.
He would, therefore, ask the planters to state what was the outside figure of the
reduction of the sharahbeshi enhancement to which they are prepared to agree.
Messrs Irwin and Norman said they were prepared to forego 25 per cent and Mr. Hill
said he was repared to forego 20 per cent as a maximum. Mr. Gandhi said that he was
not in a position at present to say off hand what percentage of reduction he would
consider to be fair and he was not sure whether the Committee were in a position to
arrive at a figure at the present moment. . . . Mr. Gandhi wanted to know if the
planters would agree to leave the percentage to be fixed by the Committee. The
planters explained their position to be that if the Committee recommended any
deduction up to 25 per cent, they would accept it; if the Committee recommended a
higher figure than 25 per cent, they would oppose it; and on the understanding that
this would be binding on all with no possibility of litigation outside such agreement.
The President remarked that he thought that any agreement would require binding by
legislation and that it now remained for the Committee to try and arrive at some
agreement on the percentage. He pointed out that in all these sharahbeshi cases, the
enhanced rents had been passed by the Settlement Courts as fair and equitable, so that
the Committee could be quite certain that any rents fixed after such a reduction of
sharahbeshi as was proposed would be a fortiori fair to the raiyats. In disputed cases,
the rent had only been passed as fair and equitable by the Settlement Courts where
they held that the tinkathia obligation was proved and the original rent was low. He
thought, therefore, that there was no fear that the new rents after reduction would not
be fair and equitable. Mr. Gandhi observed that the Settlement Officer was, in his
opinion, wrong in the decisions he gave and had misinterpreted the law. He doubted

494

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

whether the Settlement Court’s decisions would stand legal scrutiny. He also thought
that the settlement decisions were wrong in equity and again referred to the judgment
of the Special Judge in Special Appeal No. 14 of 1916 in which the contention of the
Settlement Officer that Re. 0-4-8 per rupee was an unfair enhancement had been
upheld by the Special Judge. If the Settlement Courts had considered Re. 0-4-8 to be
an unfair enhancement and had allowed only 3 annas, how could they in other cases
hold enhancements rising as high as l00 per cent to be fair and equitable? . . . Mr.
Rainy thought that Mr. Gandhi was confusing a legal enhancement with a fair and
equitable rent. The applications of the Bettiah Raj for the settlement of their rent
depended on the presumption that the existing rents were fair and equitable. In the
sharahbeshi cases, that presumption did not arise because the rents were specially
low. It was necessary to distinguish carefully the legal and equitable points of view.
Mr. Gandhi said that in determining what was a fair and equitable rent, the
outturn of the soil alone should not be taken into consideration. It did not follow
because the rent was only a small proportion of the produce, that it was too low. His
difficulty was that his view-point and that of the planters were different and there were
no cases so difficult to settle by agreement as those in which the view-point differed.
He could not agree to a penal enhancement and the proposal of a 25 per cent reduction
at present appeared to him to involve a penal enhancement. He wanted an opportunity
to examine the figures before deciding. Mr. Irwin instanced the case of Bisambharpur,
a village belonging to petty maliks1 and not in lease to him although entirely
surrounded by Bettiah Raj villages which he held in lease; the rates of rent in
Biasambharpur varied from Rs. 9 to Rs. 14 a bigha, whereas the rate of rent in the
surrounding villages in lease to him only averaged Rs. 4 to Rs. 5 a bigha, even
including the sharahbeshi. He did not see how it was possible to contend that from
the raiyats’ standpoint, the proposal was a favourable one, as it would give them a
considerable advantage. Mr. Gandhi, however, said that the legal position from the
raiyats’ stand-point was not hopeless.

*

*

*

Mr. Gandhi said that he worked out the figures as follows:
The sharahbeshi enhancement varied from 19 or 20 annas up to 30 or 32
annas per bigha. A 25 per cent reduction would reduce these enhancements to amounts
varying from 14 annas 9 pies or 15 annas to 22 annas 6 pies or 24 annas. According
to his calculation, if the rent rate was Rs. 2-6-0 per bigha, the enhancement under his
proposal would be 10 annas per bigha only and the difference between this and the
results of the other proposal was very considerable. The President said that in
1

495

Owners or proprietors
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

Motihari, the sharahbeshi was 60 per cent of the former rent. It was now proposed to
reduce it to 47 per cent, whereas Mr. Gandhi’s proposal would give only 25 per cent;
the difference was, therefore, one of 20 per cent. Mr. Rainy pointed out that it was
misleading in some cases to judge by percentage because in cases where the
percentage was high, e.g., Pipra, the absolute amount of the rent was low. The
President pointed out that both in Turkaulia and Motihari the raiyats had paid
enhanced rents for 6 years with no objections, save in a very few cases, and he
thought that a reduction of 25 per cent was a very considerable concession to the
raiyats. Mr. Gandhi said that he looked at it from the point of view of what the
raiyats had the right to demand 6 years ago, because it was only through their
ignorance of their legal position that they had not raised any objections before. The
President said that he saw no other way of avoiding a tribunal except settlement by
consent, and it was very uncertain whether the raiyats would get such good terms from
the tribunal as those now offered. Even if Mr. Gandhi was not satisfied that the
present rent including sharahbeshi reduced as proposal was fair and equitable, could
he not be satisfied that rent was capable of being easily paid? Mr. Gandhi said that he
thought the Champaran raiyat was poor and he was not prepared to admit that the rent
could be paid easily. . . . Mr. Gandhi said that the class of raiyats had to be considered
as well as the possibilities of the soil and the Champaran raiyat was by nature a bad
cultivator. In his opinion, if rents were apparently low, there was generally a very
good reason for it. He considered that the raiyats had fully paid for this concession of
abstention from rent enhancement and his view of the legal position was that the
raiyats could free themselves from the obligation without paying any compensation.
In saying this, he did not mean to imply that he wished indigo to disappear; he would
advise the raiyats to grow indigo, provided they got reasonable rates for it. . . . Mr.
Rainy said on the basis of Mr. Sweeney’s figures of produce the Pipra rents were very
low, the Motihari rents moderate and even the Turkaulia rents were not high; if 25 per
cent of the sharahbeshi, was taken off, it would give an ample margin of safety. Mr.
Gandhi said he could not bring himself to accept the proposal of a 25 per cent
reduction. Mr. Reid inquired whether the alternative to a settlement by agreement was
the suggestion of a tribunal. Mr. Gandhi said that if the Committee could not come to
an agreement, he would be prepared to accept the suggestion of a tribunal, but he
asked whether the Committee could not recommend a higher reduction. The President
said that he thought the Committee had got the highest possible figures out of the
planters and he was not prepared to agree to higher figure. He could not imagine that
any raiyats would ever regret having accepted this proposal; the only raiyats who
might be discontented were the few raiyats who still grew indigo. Mr. Gandhi said
that the raiyats thought that they could get rid of sharahbeshi by legal methods even
in cases where it had been settled under section 10 (C). He did not see, therefore, that
they would regret not accepting the present proposal.

496

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

Mr. Gandhi enquired what was to be done in the case of the Jalaha concern in
the event of the Committee reaching a conclusion on the general question. In that
concern, sharahbeshi had been taken by making tenants surrender their holdings
which were then resettled with their relatives on an enhanced rent. The Civil Court
had held in some cases that the old tenants should be restored at the former rent. The
President said that this was the first occasion that the matter had been brought to his
notice and he thought that they ought to ascertain the facts and hear what Mr.
Jameson had to say before coming to any conclusion about it. . . .
Returning to the general question, Mr. Adami said that the equity of the
position would be to wash out the past 50 years and put the parties back in the
position they would have been if indigo had not been grown. Mr. Gandhi said that
this could not be done as the raiyat had given up far more than he had gained during
that period. Mr. Rainy pointed out the high rents in Madhuban Babu’s estate. Mr.
Gandhi admitted that Indian zamindars had enhanced their raiyats’ rents. . . . The
President then said that as Mr. Gandhi could not agree to the 25 per cent reduction,
there were two courses open—the Committee could recommend the view of the
majority that a 25 per cent reduction was fair; Mr. Gandhi would in a note of dissent
give his reasons for thinking that a higher figure was required and it could be left to
Government to decide between these two views and legislate accordingly. That
course, however, could only be adopted if he was satisfied that the decision of
Government whatever it might be would be accepted. If it was not accepted, the
position of strife and unrest would still remain and in that event the Committee would
have to recommend the alternative procedure of settlement of rents by a special
tribunal. He hoped that in the interest of peace, it would be possible to adopt the first
alternative, it being understood that whatever Government decided would be loyally
accepted. Mr. Gandhi said that he could promise to accept the decision of Government
and would refrain from advising the raiyats to resist it. Mr. Reid enquired what should
be done as regards pending legislation. Mr. Gandhi said that he thought it desirable to
forward their recommendation to Government at once, so that a decision might be
reached and pending legislation stopped as soon as possible. Mr. Adami pointed out
that the legislation would take time and the President added that Government would
probably decide first to publish the Committee’s report and give time to the public
and the parties to consider the proposals. It would facilitate the preparation of the
report and possibly I ncrease the chance of Government being able to arrive at a
decision if Mr. Gandhi could put before the Committee the reduction to which he was
prepared to go. Mr. Gandhi said that he would go through the figures again and give
his minimum figure.

402. LETTER TO ESTHER FAERING
BETTIAH,

August 12, 1917
MY DEAR ESTHER,

I have a moment to spare today. The lines you send are good
and true. Belief and hope are great. They are indispensable for
success. But love is greater. I find here that too great a strain is put
upon it. Only this morning a powerfully built man came to me and
insisted on my giving him help which was not in my power to give
him. He would not leave me. I begged of him. He began weeping and
beating his breast. His case is nothing. He came out of hope and love.
How would I, wanting to love him, treat him? Assuming that his
weeping was sincere, must I put up with his presence and go on
talking to him? Such problems arise every day. Love has to be patient.
How to apply the injunction in cases such as I have quoted? The only
safe guide is the monitor within if one is pure-minded and sure of
one’s sincerity. We often deceive ourselves.
You may write for the time being to Ahmedabad which I expect
to reach within a week from now. The Committee will have finished its
deliberations within 3 days from today.
What treatment did you receive when you had the snake bite?
How did you manage to get bitten? Where did it bite you? Was the
snake caught and killed? I am always interested in the question of
snake-bites and snakes.
With love from us all,
Yours,

405. LETTER TO CHAIRMAN, CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE
BETTIAH,

August 13, 1917
DEAR MR. SLY,

I have thought, slept, prayed and read 1 Cor. XIII which latter I
always do before coming to the committee meetings. I have discussed
the question with my friends too. I was surprised to find in Babu
Brajkishore the strongest supporter of Mr. Rainy’s energetic defence
of the fairness of the enhancement so far as it is measured by the
outturn. All the others resisted him. Babu Brajkishore to my
astonishment held his ground and said that on the score of lowness of
rent he was entirely at one with Mr. Sweeney’s finding. His argument
however is totally unconvincing. But all my friends held that I would
sell the raiyats’ cause, if I agreed to the planters’ proposition. They
unanimously appreciated the fact that the planters who are so strong
in every way had at all accepted the idea of a reduction of
sharahbeshi. The majority of them would have me to buy peace from
the committee even though it may mean a big sacrifice. I thought that
I ought to mention these pleasing incidents. They augur well for the
future. My friends who represent, as I hold, the culture of Bihar are
not fanatics as planter-friends have so often urged. There is no greater
fanatic among us than myself.
Now for my offer which is absolutely final. My last state was to
accept the Raja Saheb’s proposition1 . That reduced to percentage
represents a reduction of 55 per cent as against the planters’ 25 per
cent. And if I am to write a dissenting minute, I should write in
defence of that offer with the clearest conscience. For the sake of
securing unanimity among ourselves, I am prepared to accept a
reduction of 40 per cent only, i.e., 15 per cent more than the planters’
1

Raja Kirtyanand Sinha’s proposal circulated to members, Select Document
No. 161, not given here

500

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

offer. For me this borders, in my language, upon the penal. Under the
planters’ offer, they get Re. 0-6-7 per rupee, under mine Re. 0-5-3
per rupee. My final offer therefore covers all possibilities, the
possibility even of Mr. Whitty’s1 appeal succeeding.
My own original offer was a rise of Re. 0-3-0 in the rupee. That
is equivalent to a reduction of 66 per cent. My present offer
represents a reduction of 40 per cent. I have therefore put up 26 per
cent. If then pressure is now to be applied, it must be not to me but to
the planters.
Mr. Irwin has without the slightest justification taken large sums
in tawan and has collected sharahbeshi for the past 6 years. He can
have little to grumble about if he accepts my offer. For both Turkaulia
and Peeprah, there is evidence before the committee of sufficient
pressure exerted upon the raiyats to vitiate sharahbeshi. We have it on
record that Mr. Sweeney in coming to his decision on coercion had
not read the judgment in Lomraj Singh’s case nor had he the full
Bench decision before him on undue influence. It is settled law now
that there is no distinction between undue influence and coercion. I
just mention these facts to show that we as a committee dare not
ignore them. It is not possible to base our decision merely on the
theoretical ground of the so-called lowness of rent.
I am sure the committee will think a hundred times before
putting on the Government the strain of arbitrating upon a figure
dispute between its members. I have gone to the furthest limit in order
to avoid any such calamity. If you and the other members cannot find
it in your conscience to accept my approach, I shall sorrowfully write
my minute of dissent but it will be, as I have said, in support of 55 per
cent reduction. 40 per cent reduction is for the consideration of the
members (and the planters only, if, in your opinion, they should be
consulted again).
Yours sincerely,

M. K. GANDHI

406. MINUTES OF CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE MEETING
August 14, 1917
The President said that a letter1 received from Mr. Gandhi stated that a
compromise on the basis of a reduction of 25 per cent was outside the possibility of
his acceptance. Mr. Gandhi further wrote that provided he obtained the unanimous
consent of the Committee, he would agree to a 40 per cent reduction, but if that was
not accepted, he would in a note of dissent recommend a reduction of 55 per cent. The
President put this proposal to the meeting. Mr. Reid said that he could not recommend
the planters to give up more than 25 per cent and it would be useless for him to go to
them again. In particular, he referred to the case of Mr. Hill where the reduction of 25
per cent would bring his rents down to little more than he could have got from the
ordinary enhancement on the ground of rise in prices. Mr. Gandhi said that he would
always be prepared to recognise the principle of a different reduction in different
concerns. The President, however, pointed out that it was clear that the proposal for a
settlement by compromise had failed. He assumed that Mr. Gandhi would now write a
minute of dissent advocating a 55 per cent reduction. He did not wish to press him for
further concessions, but asked him to consider one point. Both parties were anxious
not to have a special tribunal or to have matters settled by the ordinary courts. If the
report went up with the recommendation in its present form, Government would have
to arbitrate between a reduction of 25 per cent and one of 55 per cent, and he was very
doubtful if Government would consent to arbitrate between such wide limits, though
they might possibly be inclined to arbitrate between the narrower limits of 25 per
cent and 40 per cent. He, therefore, asked Mr. Gandhi if it would not be possible in
his minute of dissent to put his figure at 40 per cent. Mr. Gandhi said he did not see
why Government should refuse to arbitrate if the limits were wide. The President then
made another suggestion that if he approached Government on the subject of
arbitration on the basis that Mr. Gandhi stated in his minute of dissent his
willingness to abide by the decision of Government, he asked whether Mr. Gandhi
would object to his telling Government that an offer of compromise at 40 per cent had
been made from his side. Mr. Gandhi said he was willing to let Government know all
the facts including the fact that he had offered to compromise at 40 per cent but was
not prepared to agree that the limits for arbitration should be any other than between
25 per cent and 55 per cent. Mr. Reid pointed out that the planters’ offer of 25 per cent
was final and it should be put in on the same basis as Mr. Gandhi’s final offer of 40
per cent. Mr. Gandhi said that he was willing for Government to arbitrate between the
extreme limits of no reduction at all and a 100 per cent reduction and also that they
should know that the planters were prepared to go as far as 25 per cent and that he was
1

502

Vide the preceding item.
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

prepared to go as far as 40 per cent. He was also prepared to state this in his minute of
dissent in order to show how reasonable he had been. The President then said that he
had a final proposal to put forward. He knew that Mr. Gandhi was aware of his
personal view that the raiyats would be well advised to accept 25 per cent. He had
gone through Mr. Gandhi’s views and had done his best to realise the raiyats’
position. He was personally unwilling to put forward any proposal for arbitration by
Government, because the Committee would thus have failed in its full task and
because the Government could hardly be in a better position to arbitrate than the
Committee. As Mr. Gandhi was willing to allow Government to arbitrate, he asked if
he would have sufficient trust in him to leave the arbitration in his hands, subject to
three conditions:
(1) That in no case would he arbitrate at a figure lower than the mean between
25 per cent and 40 per cent,
(2) He would endeavour to secure the consent of the planters to the figure
which he fixed, and
(3) He would endeavour to secure the unanimous consent of the Committee.
Mr. Gandhi agreed that the Committee should bear the burden itself, if
possible. He doubted whether it was possible for the President at this stage to bring a
fresh mind to bear on the situation, particularly after the President had advocated
enhancement of rent in lieu of abwab which was diametrically opposed to his views.
The President said that he could only arbitrate between the limits of 25 per cent and
40 per cent and, as a matter of fact, had already practically fixed a figure. Mr. Gandhi
said that in that case, as the President had made up his mind, he could not agree as
there was no hope of his being able to convince the President of the justice of the
raiyats’ case. The President then said that as the offer had not been accepted, he now
wished to put before the Committee another proposal. The utmost limit to which the
planters would agree was 25 per cent. The utmost limit to which Mr. Gandhi would
agree on behalf of the raiyats was 40 per cent. There was a difference of 15 per cent.
In thinking out a possible means of bridging this chasm, a solution had occurred to
him while considering Mr. Gandhi’s arguments. Mr. Irwin had, in the course of the
discussion on the 12th of August, stated that his mukarrari leases were unprofitable
on the old rental and Mr. Gandhi’s reply to this was that the planters should have
squeezed the Bettiah Raj and not the raiyats. The lines, therefore, on which he had
thought of a solution were that the Committee should recommend a reduction in
sharahbeshi approximating to 40 per cent, of which the planters would be
responsible for 25 per cent and the Bettiah Raj would bear the balance until the next
settlement. He proposed a limitation of period as regards the contribution of the
Bettiah Estate by analogy with the case of tawan, in which it had been decided that the
Raj should forego enhanced rents for a certain period. Mr. Gandhi said that the

503

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

proposal was attractive in theory but he would want a strong evidence that the
mukarrari leases were not a paying proposition before he could agree. The President
pointed out that Mr. Whitty had told him that on the whole the profit on the
mukarrari leases was very small. At the time they were given the jama was fixed at
the full rental or in excess thereof and the increase of rent since that time had been
small. Mr. Gandhi thought that they could state in the report that one planter had
given evidence that the mukarrari leases without indigo involved a loss and that if
this was proved to the satisfaction of the Court of Wards to be generally the case, the
Committee recommended that the Bettiah Estate should bear part of the burden. He did
not think that on the evidence before him they could definitely make a proposal of
this nature because hitherto all the enquiries had been directed towards the relations
between the planters and the raiyats without considering the position of the Bettiah
Estate. The President said that his proposition was that whatever balance there was
between 25 per cent and the figure agreed upon should be borne by the Raj. This would
be done by the Raj reducing their mukarrari rental by this figure for a period of years.
He had satisfied himself that the proposal was equitable, as far as the Estate was
concerned. The mukarrari jama received by the Bettiah Estate was high owing to the
indigo industry; the Estate had, therefore, profited by the industry and, if the
obligation of indigo-growing had to be commuted, it was fair that a portion of this
should be borne by the Estate. Moreover, if there was no settlement of the present
dispute by agreement, the Estate might find it hard to realise their jamas owing to the
difficulties of the planters and further from the point of view of a good landlord, the
Estate should contribute towards the settlement of the dispute. As the Estate was now
getting an enhancement of rents in its kham and thika villages, its finances would be
well able to bear this extra payment. The actual amount of sharahbeshi, so far as it
could be ascertained, was about Rs. 1_ lakhs, 15 per cent of which was Rs. 22,500,
this being the maximum amount which the Estate would have to forego annually if the
full reduction of 40 per cent was fixed. He did not think that it was just that the Raj
should forego it in perpetuity and for that reason he limited it to a period extending up
to the next settlement 15 or 20 years hence. Mr. Gandhi said that before agreeing he
would have to satisfy himself that the Estate had not profited by indigo and he would
like to know the circumstances under which the leases had originally been given. The
President thought that the Estate could equitably bear part of the burden whether the
leases had been favourable or not because but for indigo the Estate would not have
secured such high jamas. Mr. Reid pointed out that in addition to the high jama , very
large nazarana had been paid at the time the leases were given. Mr. Gandhi observed
that the taking of the leases was a commercial bargain and, if owing to present
circumstances the bargain turned out unprofitable, that was no reason why the Bettiah
Raj should suffer now. The President said that it was just because it was a commercial
bargain that the Bettiah Estate should now bear a part of the burden of giving up the

504

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

obligation on which the bargain was based. Mr. Gandhi replied that the Bettiah Raj
and the planters were the only parties to the bargain and he asked why the Raj should
pay because accidents had happened. The material before the Committee was he
thought, too small to come to a conclusion. The President said that the only
additional evidence that was required as far as he could see was information as to the
rental paid-in each village and a comparison of that with the mukkarrari jama. Mr.
Gandhi said that if the planters were going to get the same amount of indigo on the
khuski system by paying a fair rate he did not see that any loss would accrue to them
from the commutation. Mr. Adami pointed out that if a struggle went on between the
planters and the raiyats, the Bettiah Estate would inevitably lose money by it and it
was therefore to the interests of the Estate to make some sacrifice in order to bring
about a settlement. Mr. Gandhi replied that these were considerations outside the
main point of the equity of making the Raj pay but he was willing to embody in the
report a statement of the planters case against the Bettiah Raj but he did not think
that the Committee were called upon to decide that case. Mr. Adami said he thought
they might state the outside limit to which the two parties would go namely, 25 per
cent and 40 per cent. After stating the case for the planters against the Estate he
suggested that the Estate should pay the difference if Government found the case to be
proved. The President asked if the Committee could not go further and find that it was
proved. Mr. Gandhi doubted whether they could get sufficient information as to the
mukarrari leases. The President pointed out that the information from the
Government records was that the Maharaja himself gave the leases in order to get
security for the sterling loan.1
Mr. Gandhi said that he looked at the matter purely as a commercial
transaction and could not see why the Bettiah Raj should pay anything because
the transaction had become unprofitable to the planters. He thought that by friendly
relations and good will in the district there was a future for indigo. Mr. Reid observed
that after the next settlement, the planters would be bearing the full burden.
Mr. Gandhi pointed out that they would get the usual enhancement at that time
on the ground of rise in prices but the President observed that the planters would never
get back the 25 per cent which they were now giving up. Mr. Rainy said that, under
1
Some indigo planters secured permanent leases from the Bettiah Raj in 1888,
taking advantage of the latter’s necessity to obtain a loan of £475,000 which was
floated in England on the security of the indigo planters. The loan was negotiated
through a Calcutta firm with the help of another in London and was within the
knowledge of the Government of India and the Lt.-Governor of Bengal. A condition
attached to the loan was that the Maharaja of Bettiah could appoint a successor to T. M.
Gibbon, the then Manager of the Raj and an ex-planter, only with the approval of the
Lt.-Governor of Bengal. Vide Select Documents on Mahatma Gandhi’s Movement in
Champaran, p. 6.

VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act, once the landlord had foregone his rent
enhancement, he could never recover it. Mr. Gandhi remarked that Indian thikadars
were able to drive a coach and four through the Bengal Tenancy Act; although the big
estates could not do this, the small estates found it easy to get their tenants to pay
enhanced rents. Mr. Reid said that he had no objection to accept the proposal if Mr.
Gandhi agreed to it, though he considered it hard on the planters. Mr. Rainy said that
he agreed with Mr. Gandhi that it was necessary for the Committee to be sure of its
ground. He would not have hesitated to suggest the proposal to the Raj with a view to
promoting a settlement of the dispute if there had been a Maharaja but, as
Government was trustee for the management of the Estate, it was necessary to
consider the proposal carefully before suggesting it. He did not think that the Estate
could divest itself of responsibility for the present position. The President asked if it
would not be sufficient if the Committee examined the correspondence regarding the
mukarrari leases and considered the mukarrari jama and the rentals of the villages
both at the time when the leases were granted and at present. Mr. Gandhi thought that
this would not be sufficient as the Court of Wards would want to know if there was
going to be a loss to the planters in future; that the Committee was now bringing in a
third party and was bound to consider that party’s position. Mr. Reid asked why they
could not leave it to Government; but the President pointed out that if possible the
Committee ought to decide for themselves. He said that if this proposal was not
accepted, there was no alternative but to recommend a special tribunal or to leave the
decision of cases to the ordinary Court. If there had been only one dissent to the
proposal about Government arbitration, it might have been possible to leave it to
Government but Raja Kirtyanand Sinha’s dissent made arbitration impossible. He
thought the planters stood to lose by this course and that the raiyats stood to lose
even more. Mr. Adami said that it was clearly to the interests of the Raj to agree to the
proposal which should be recommended to Government who would naturally consult
the Board of Revenue before passing orders. He was prepared to accept the proposal.
Raja Kirtyanand Sinha also said he was prepared to accept the proposal, though the
ultimate orders of Government would depend on the view taken by the Court of Wards.
Mr. Rainy agreed but that the Committee should try and convince Government that
the proposal was a fair one. Mr. Gandhi said that even if he satisfied himself that the
proposal was fair, he would not agree to let the Raj bear the loss for so long a period
as 15 years. Mr. Reid pointed out that it was for Government to satisfy itself on the
point. Mr. Gandhi said he thought he would be on dangerous ground if he accepted the
proposal without knowing the facts, and even so he could not accept it without
knowing what was going to happen in future. He thought that the Committee could
not bind down the Raj to a prospective loss. He, therefore, put forward an alternative
proposal. He said that the dispute was merely as to figures and that if the Committee
had accepted his view, there would have been no need to bring the Bettiah Raj into

506

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

consideration. He proposed that the planters on the one side and he on the other on
behalf of raiyats should put their views to arbitration, not by Government, nor by the
Committee but by a separate body. He proposed as arbitrators Mr. Apperley 1 and
Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya who would select a third arbitrator as an umpire
between them, or, if the Committee did not agree to that, he would suggest Mr.
Heycock. Both parties would state their case to the arbitrators who would have before
them also the views of the Committee. They would then give their decision which
would be embodied in the Committee’s report. Mr. Reid said that he could not agree to
this proposal. The planters had already gone to the full extent of their concession and
he was sure that they would not agree to this suggestion of arbitration. Mr. Rainy
also thought that the planters would not consent. With a 25 per cent reduction, the
average enhancement in the Turkaulia concern would be 4 annas 10 pies; if the rates
of permissible enhancement in the Sardar Sub-division worked out at much the same
as they had in the Bettiah Sub-division, the Turkaulia concern could go to the
Munsif’s Court and get the enhancement at 4 annas 8 pies in the rupee; it was clear,
therefore, that it would be no advantage to them to consent to an arbitration which
would almost certainly involve a loss. The President said that in these circumstances
the matter would have to be left in the position that his proposal regarding the
Bettiah Raj was supported by the majority of the Committee, and Mr. Gandhi would
not oppose it if Government satisfied itself that it was fair to the Bettiah Estate.
Failing that, the alternative solution of a special tribunal would be recommended.
. . . . The President then said there was one small point which he desired to
bring to notice. Mr. Gandhi had all along agreed that raiyats should have their rents
enhanced by the amount permissible on account of the rise in prices. There was a
possibility of difficulty arising in the Rajghat concern owing to its forbearance. He
asked therefore if Mr. Gandhi agreed to a special recommendation that in the Rajghat
concern there should be an enhancement of rent on the ground of rise in prices and an
increase of rent on the ground of excess area by the application of section 112,
Bengal Tenancy Act. Mr. Gandhi agreed.
Tawan: In connection with the question of tawan, Mr. Gandhi said
that he had been looking up cases of tawan in recently leased villages and had made a
list of the cases in which he thought indigo sattas had been taken merely for the
purposes of releasing tawan and he suggested that in any case where tawan
had been taken in villages where indigo had been grown for less than 10 years,
the whole of the tawan should be refunded. The President asked if the Committee
could not agree to a general recommendation that, if tawan had been imposed in a
village within the last few years which had never grown indigo, the whole should be
refunded Mr. Reid suggested that the decision of such cases should be left to the
1

507

Perhaps F. W. Apperley, Manager of Rajghat Concern
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

Bettiah Raj. Mr. Rainy pointed out that the objectionable cases were those in which
it was certain that sattas had been executed for the purpose of taking tawan and
nothing else. It was unsafe to rely on dates in this matter and he could not agree to a
fixed period of 10 years. He thought that it would be easy to find a form of words to
which they could all agree and suggested that they should recommend that when it
appeared to the Bettiah Estate that indigo sattas were taken with the object of taking
tawan and not for growing indigo the Estate should insist on the whole of the tawan
being refunded. The President suggested the addition that where the factory after
growing indigo for one year proceeded to take tawan it should be presumed that the
sattas were taken for the purposes of levying tawan and nothing else. This was
agreed too.
Thika Leases: Mr. Gandhi suggested that the Committee should recommend
that thika leases should be for short periods only. The President said that in his
experience short-term leases were a very great temptation to the thikadars to fleece
the raiyats. The policy in the Central Provinces had been to lengthen the leases but to
impose strict conditions as to their cancellation and he thought that this policy was
much wiser than that of short leases. Mr. Gandhi withdrew his suggestion. . . .
Special Tribunal: As regards the proposals for the special tribunal Mr. Gandhi
suggested as an amendment that an appeal should be allowed to the High Court. Mr.
Rainy thought that if any amendment was necessary it was in the other direction, his
idea being that the tribunal should be composed of a senior Revenue Officer and a
senior Judicial Officer and that there should be no appeal from their decision. What
was wanted was finality, and several appeals would make matters little better than if
they were left to be dealt with by the ordinary courts. Mr. Gandhi said that he would
prefer a special court of three members if there was to be no appeal but would like to
think the matter over.
The Committee then adjourned.

It would seem that what we have been fighting for was within

country, having nothing else to do, go on talking endlessly and
discussing political matters but this meeting proves them wrong. The
Government has prohibited students [from attending political
meetings], but that has not kept away all of them.3 And now the
business community is also realizing the importance of political

charge of all public movements in India, no good can be done to the
country. British merchants have earned a name by fighting for their
freedom. Ahmedabad is the capital of Gujarat and wields much
influence. If business men elsewhere start taking livelier interest in
political agitations, as you of Ahmedabad are doing, India is sure to
achieve her aim.

I still have two of your letters to answer. Do not give up the
morning prayer. And I want you to remember Indian dates.
I have to go to Champaran again. Take care of your health. You
write nothing about it. You will have received my previous letters.
It does not cause me pain that your thoughts are turning towards
marriage. I shall certainly help to the extent I can if you will accept
my choice. I am looking around for a girl. No money must be spent
on marriage. There will be some little expenditure, but that hardly
matters. One thing is certain. You must marry only after you have
begun to earn. I do not think it will be difficult for you to find some
means of livelihood. My advice is this: for the present you should with
a steady mind continue to work for Indian Opinion. Make the
position of the paper sound. Only when you find that it can carry on
without you should you come away. If you can find independent
means of livelihood there and can side by side work for Indian
Opinion, there can be no objection to it. Consult Mr. West. See that
your name is not disgraced. Whatever work you may choose to do it
will not pain me so long as it does not degrade you. My happiness lies
in your satisfaction. You may fearlessly pour out your feelings to me.

Your criticism of . . . 1 appears to be mistaken. If he goes to what
are (to him) innocent dances and if no expenditure is involved, there
can be no harm. It is true that I do not easily believe bad things said
about a person I have come to trust. It is a virtue, not a failing. Still,
you must write to me whatever comes to your notice.
Tell Miss Schlesin to write to me. I am awaiting her arrival. Tell
her also that there are some ten letters from me she has not answered.
Remember me to all the others. Visit Mr. Phillip and Mr. Doke.
Of course if you are already back from Johannesburg that is another
thing. In that case write to them. Write to Capetown too.Also, tell
Nagarji and Bhaga—or write to them—that these days I have no time
at all to spare.
Mr. Polak is leaving for England in a couple of days. I am
going to Bombay to see him. Ba and Devdas will not accompany me
this time.

411. TALK WITH MAHADEV DESAI
August 31, 1917
. . . . On the morning of 31st August, certain words of Bapuji created in me the
mixed feelings of love, dismay and joy. I shall now try to pen in this letter my short
talk with him on that day, although it cannot be easily put into words. Bapuji said:

It is not without reason that I have asked you to visit my place
every day. I want you to come and stay with me. I have seen your
capacity during the last three days. I have found in you just the type
of young man for whom I have been searching for the last two years.
Will you believe me if I tell you that I have got in you the man I
wanted—the man to whom I can entrust all my work some day and be
at ease, and on whom I can rely with confidence? You have to come to
me. Leave the Home Rule League, Shri Jamnadas and everything else.
I have spoken like this only to three persons before this, Mr. Polak,
Miss Schlesin and Shri Maganlal. Today I am speaking in the same
1

way to you and I am very happy to do so, for I have found three
outstanding qualities in you. They are regularity, fidelity and
intelligence. When I first picked up Maganlal, to all appearances he
had nothing special about him. But today you are surprised by his
personality. He was not educated. I trained him first for press work.
He learnt composing in Gujarati and then in English, Hindi, Tamil and
other languages. I was surprised at the speed at which he mastered the
art. Since then he has shown his skill in various kinds of work. Let us,
however, leave aside Maganlal. The intelligence I have found in you I
did not see in him. I am confident that you will be useful to me in
various ways because of your good qualities.
1 listened to all this with surprise and shyness, without speaking a single
word. I interrupted by saying, ‘I have never shown you anything I have done’, to
which he answered as follows:

How do you know? I can judge people in a very short time. I
judged Polak within five hours. He read my letter published in a
newspaper and wrote me a letter. He then came to see me and I at
once saw what he was, and since then he became my man. He married
and started his practice as a pleader only after he joined me. He told
me before marriage that he must earn a little for his children. I told
him plainly, ‘You are mine and the responsibility to provide for you
and your children is mine, not yours. I am getting you married, as I
see no objection to your marrying.’ His marriage was celebrated at
my residence. But to revert to the point under discussion. I advise you
to give up all thought about the Home Rule League or Jamnadas. Go
to Hyderabad. Enjoy yourself for a year or so. Enjoy the pleasures of
life to your satisfaction. The moment you start feeling that you are
losing yourself, resign from there and come and join me.
At this I told him that I was prepared even then to join him. But he replied:

I know that you are prepared but I want you to see a
little more of life and enjoy yourself. I would need your knowledge
of the Co-operative Movement also. We have to free that department
from its defects. Do not be anxious about anything and come
back to me after enjoying life for a little longer. I need you for me
personally, not for the school, nor for any other work. You may
continue where you are for a year or six months. I shall manage
without you till then.
Send me back this letter after you have read it, for I have given Bapu’s talk in
his own words. They may be forgotten in course of time.

ANNIE BESANT’S EXPLANATION REGARDING BENARES INCIDENT
I
MADRAS ,
February 10, 1916
As Mr. Gandhi has made a statement1 which appears by wire in our columns, I
think it well to say that my interruption was due to the fact that the Englishman
behind me, who, I concluded, was a C.I.D. officer, made the remark, “Everything he
says is being taken down and will be sent to the Commissioner.” As several things
said were capable of a construction that I knew Mr. Gandhi could certainly not mean
to convey, I thought it better to suggest to the Chairman that politics were out of
place in that meeting. I did not suggest to the Princes to leave nor do I know who did.
I am well aware Mr. Gandhi would rather be killed than kill. But I do think that his
remarks were capable of misconstruction and I feared for his personal safety under
conditions existing in Benares. How far from any wish of his is any disturbance of
the public peace was shown by his view that we ought not to embarrass the
Government even by holding the Congress.

The above came to us from the Madras Mail. Mr. Gandhi telephoned to ask if
I would put in a statement from him, and I answered yes. I presume that the above from
the Madras Mail is the statement.
I regret that I must traverse the first paragraph of the statement. I do not see
how, “if Mrs. Besant was almost behind me”, he could have seen me “whispering” to
the princes on the far side of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, nor how they could have
heard my whispers; there was one prince on my side, who did not move till after all
the rest had gone. I did not leave with the princes, but remained with my friends round
me, and in fact Mr. Gandhi says, was discussing with them, while he also says that l
left along with the princes. I did not leave till some minutes after the meeting was
over, and then not even by the way they went, but by a path which led towards my
house from the platform.

I have no report of Mr. Gandhi’s speech, but he desires me to mention the
statements which I thought necessitated the interruption. I answer that I thought that
in a non-political meeting, with princes and many others present who would suffer
from Government displeasure, he should not have twice spoken of the possibility of
the English being driven bag and baggage out of the country and of his being ready, if
he thought Indians fit for self-Government which he did not, to march with thousands
of his countrymen to the muzzle of English guns and die gloriously; that it was
unwise to say bluntly, “I am an anarchist,” without explaining what he meant, and to
speak of bombs bringing about the annulment of the partition of Bengal, with praise
of the heroism of those who threw them. I know very well how such statements would
appear in a C.I.D. report, as I have suffered from such reports, and I appealed to the
Chairman. If the meeting had been called by Mr. Gandhi, it would have been no one’s
business but his own what he chose to say; as it was, the University Committee, to
which I belong, was responsible to those we had invited. It may be that I ought to
have left Mr. Gandhi to go his own way, despite the . . . and the complaints all around
me. I meant to do him a kindness and prevent the more violent interruption which
would have probably taken place, had I remained silent. l am glad that Mr. Gandhi has
explained what he meant to say, though I regret his misstatement about myself.
Mr. S. S. Setlur’s letter, which I subjoin from the Hindu, gives accurately what
occurred.
New India, 17-2-1916

III1
Those who have read Mr. Gandhi’s statement on his speech, and his request to
me to state the remarks to which I objected, will at once recognize his perfect
innocence of all wrong intention. . . .
. . . But now that Mr. Gandhi himself has forced my hand, asking for what I had
refused to others, I am free to speak out, and to say why words which, from another,
would have connoted wrong, were, so far as his intent was concerned, innocent of
harm. Moreover, he did not know, as I knew, that the students before him were
seething with anger in consequence of the way in which they had been treated by the
C.I.D. officers, a number of them interned in the College for the day—a gratuitous and
provocative insult—and also of the way in which respectable men in the town had
been arrested during previous days, and others, men and even old women, very
roughly used. It was a rather “gun-powder” audience, and I feared that some of them,
not knowing Mr. Gandhi’s principle of non-resistance, might take his remarks on the
results of bomb-throwing as a justification for the use of such means, despite his
strictures on them.
To consider the remarks themselves, what Mr. Gandhi said as to the English
leaving India by compulsion was, I venture to think, unwise, but it did not bear the
1

514

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

sense that it would have had in my own mouth, since I am actively working for Home
Rule. If I had said it, it would have been a threat, because it would have been naturally
connected in the minds of many with my demand that India should be a self-governing
nation, and although I work only for the abolition of bureaucratic rule, and hope that
many an Englishman will help in the working of the responsible Government of the
future, It would naturally have been said: “Why should you suggest such a thing, if
you do not want to bring it about?” But no such motive can be imputed to Mr. Gandhi,
for he distinctly said: “You are not fit for self-government,” and he told the students
not to be led away by himself into the idea that they were. IF HE THOUGHT THEM
READY, which he did not, he would be willing to march up to the mouth of the guns
and die. But it must be remembered that from Mr. Gandhi’s lips this does not mean
fighting, as it would mean from mine. He has already led a crowd against armed men,
willing to die but not to slay. His resistance has always been passive, the heroic
endurance of suffering, NEVER the infliction of it. And therefore I say that he cannot
be judged as an active politician should be. He has risked the lives of himself and his
followers, but never those of his opponents.
It was unwise to say boldly: “I am an anarchist”, in a country where
“anarchism” connotes bombs. Now Mr. Gandhi is a “philosophic anarchist”, like
Tolstoy, whom he closely resembles. Many of the noblest and purest men and women
in Europe are anarchists in the sense in which Mr. Gandhi used the word. Prince
Kropotkin, Edward Carpenter, Walt Whitman, are all men of this school; they are true
mystics, and the God within guides them; they need no outside law. The Madras Mail
was annoyed that Mr. Gandhi was, apparently, compared to Tolstoy, but Mr. Gandhi
is the greater of the two—save from the literary standpoint. Tolstoy lived as a
peasant and made shoes for his living; Gandhi lives similarly, and helps in the work
of his community. Tolstoy was detested by the Russian Government as Gandhi by the
South African; but Gandhi has suffered for his people as Tolstoy never did. Tolstay
lived a long way off, so Anglo-Indians can afford to admire him, but Gandhi is close
at hand, so must be reviled. Both are men of the prophet type and are admired by most
people—at a distance.
I have been turning up my speech of 1894, delivered in the pandal of
the Madras Congress of that year, and it is curiously applicable, in its remarks
on the Prophet, to the philosophic idea of anarchism, the “without Government”
of the far-off Golden Age, when none shall teach his brother but “all shall be
taught of God”. The Prophets, like Tolstoy, Gandhi, Carpenter, proclaim that far-off
ideal, but the work-a-day world is not ready for it, nor will be for many thousands
of years. Only when a man is guided by an interior compulsion, the divine law
within, can he afford to dispense with the compulsion of outer law. But what
outer law does Gandhi need, who leads a life of utter selflessness, of purity, of
simplicity, of daily, hourly, self-abnegation? Such men are priceless assets of the
nation which gives them birth, and they inspire to heroism and to nobility of
character. Hence, I say, that while we may consider some of Mr. Gandhi’s views as
suited better for a far-off posterity than for today, and while we regard his politics—if
VOL. 15: 21 MAY, 1915 - 31 AUGUST, 1917

515

we so name them—as impracticable, and even as a hindrance in the path of
constitutional change, we would, tens of thousands of us, stand round him, in any
attack from Anglo-Indians or from the bureaucracy, as one man, and we honour and
venerate him for his life and his lofty ideals, even when we think his words unwise in
the difficult circumstances of the time.

APPENDIX II
“AHIMSA PARAMO DHARMAH”—A TRUTH OR A FAD?
By Lala Lajpat Rai
There is no religion higher than truth, nor a course of conduct nobler than
Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah. Rightly understood and rightly applied to life, the latter
makes a man a saint and a hero. Misunderstood and misapplied, it makes a man
cowardly and craven, base and stupid. There was a time when the Indians understood it
rightly and made only the proper use of it and they were a race of truthful, noble and
brave people. Then came a time when some good people, thoroughly
well-intentioned and otherwise saintly, made a fad of it, placed it not only at the top
of all other virtues, but made it the sole test of a good life. They overdid it not only in
their own lives but converted it into a supreme national virtue at the cost of
everything else. All other virtues which ennoble men and nations were thrown into
the background and subordinated to this, according to them, the supreme test of
goodness, courage, bravery, heroism, all lapsed. Honour and self-respect were thrown
into the shade. Patriotism, love of country, love of family, honour of the race were all
extinguished. It was this perverted use or misuse of ahimsa (non-killing), or its
exaggerated importance at the cost of everything else, that brought about the social,
political and moral downfall of the Hindus. They forgot that manliness was as good a
virtue as ahimsa. In fact the former was in no way inconsistent with the latter, if
rightly applied. They overlooked the fact that individual as well as national interests
made it incumbent that the weak should be protected against the strong, and that the
aggressor and the usurper, the thief and the scoundrel, the lustful villain and the
infamous violator of women’s chastity, the ruffian and the cheat, should be prevented
from inflicting injustice and doing harm. They ignored the fact that humanity required
that the fear of righteous indignation and of the consequences that flow therefrom,
should deter the soul of the evilly disposed people from harming innocence,
violating purity and depriving others of their just rights. They failed to realize the
importance and the sublimity of the truth that whosoever allows or tolerates forceful
dominance of evil or tyranny and oppression, in a way abets and encourages it and is
partly responsible for the prosperity and strength of the evil-doer. Ahimsa overdone
and misapplied is a gangrene that poisons the system, enervates the faculties and
converts men and women into half-lunatic, hysterical, unnerved creatures, good for

516

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

nothing that requires the energetic pursuits of noble ends and noble virtues. It
converts men into monomaniacs and cowards. The founders of the Jain religion were
saintly people, pledged to a life of self-abnegation and self-mortification. Their
followers, the Jain sadhus, are amongst the most saintly people who have achieved
the greatest possible success in killing passions and subduing desires both of the
senses and the mind. The Tolstoyian ahimsa has been known and practised in India
for three thousand years. There is no country on the face of the globe which contains
so many and such profound ahimsa-ists as India does and which she has been having
for centuries. Yet there is no country on the face of the globe which is so
downtrodden, so bereft of manly virtues, as India of today is or as India of the last
fifteen hundred years has been. Some people may say that it was not the practice of
ahimsa that brought about this fall but the desertion of other virtues. I am, however,
inclined to insist that the perversion of this truth was at least one of those causes that
resulted in India’s forsaking the path of honour, manliness and virtue. The worst is
that people who profess an absolute faith in the doctrine, prove by their own practice
that a perverted use of such a truth necessarily leads to a life of hypocrisy,
unmanliness and cruelty. I was born in a Jain family. My grandfather had an
all-covering faith in ahimsa. He would rather be bitten by a snake than kill it. He
would not harm even a vermin. He spent hours in religious exercise. To all
appearances, he was a very virtuous person, who held a high position in his fraternity
and commanded great respect. One of his brothers was a sadhu, a high priest who was
an exalted leader of his order. This last-named gentleman was one of the “noblest”
types of ascetics I have ever met with in my life. He lived up to his principles and
excelled in the mortification of the flesh and in keeping down his passions and
desires. Yet according to the best standards of ethics, his life was barren and
unnatural. I loved and respected him, but I could not follow his creed, nor did he ever
show any anxiety to make me do it. His brother, however, i.e., my own grandfather,
was a different sort of person. He believed in ahimsa, that perverted ahimsa which
forbids the taking of any life under any circumstances whatsoever, but he considered
all kinds of trickeries in his trade and profession as not only valid but good. They
were permissible according to the ethics of his business. I have known many persons
of that faith who would deprive the minor and the widow of their last morsel of food in
dealings with them but who would spend thousands in saving lice or birds or other
animals standing in danger of being killed. I do not mean to say that the Jains of
India are in any way more immoral than the rest of the Hindus or that ahimsa leads to
immorality of that kind. Far be it from me to make such an unfounded insinuation. In
their own way the Jains are a great community, charitable, hospitable, and intelligent
and shrewd men of business. So are some of the other communities 0among the
Hindus. What I mean is that the practice of ahimsa in its extreme form has in no way
made them better than or morally superior to the other communities. In fact, they are
the people who pre-eminently suffer from hooliganism and other manifestations of
force, because they are more helpless than others, on account of their inherited fear
and dislike of force. They cannot defend themselves, nor the honour of those dear and

near to them. Europe is the modern incarnation of the divine right of force. It is good
for Europe to have given birth to a Tolstoy. But the case of India is different. In India
we do not advocate force and violence for purposes of oppression or usurpation or
aggression. India, I trust, will never come to that. But we cannot afford to be taught
that it is sinful to use legitimate force for purposes of self-defence or for the
protection of our honour and the honour of our wives, sisters, daughters and mothers.
Such a teaching is unnatural and pernicious. We condemn illegal or unlawful force in
the attainment of a lawful object, but we cannot afford to sit silent when a great and a
respected man tells our young men that we can only “guard the honour of those who
are under our charge by delivering ourselves into the hands of the men who would
commit the sacrilege” and that this requires “far great physical and mental courage
than delivering blows”. Suppose a ruffian assaults our daughter. Mr. Gandhi says that
according to his conception of ahimsa, the only way to protect the honour of our
daughter is to stand between her and her assailant. But what becomes of the daughter if
her assailant fells us and then completes his diabolical intention? According to Mr.
Gandhi, it requires greater mental and physical courage to stand still and let him do
his worst than to try to stop him by matching our force against his. With great
respect for Mr. Gandhi, this has no meaning. I have the greatest respect for the
personality of Mr. Gandhi. He is one of those persons whom l idolize. I do not doubt
his sincerity. I do not question his motives. But I consider it my duty to raise an
emphatic protest against the pernicious doctrine he is reported to have propounded.
Even a Gandhi should not be allowed to poison the minds of Young India on this
subject. No one should be at liberty to pollute the fountains of national vitality. Not
even Buddha, much less Christ, even preached that. I do not know if even the Jains
would go to that length. Why! honourable life would be impossible under such
conditions. A man who has such a faith cannot consistently resist anyone acting as he
likes. Why did Mr. Gandhi then injure the feelings of the white men of South Africa by
raising the standard of revolt against their cherished policy of excluding the Indians
from that country? To be logical he should have left the country bag and baggage and
advised his countrymen to do the same as soon as the South Africans expressed a wish
to exclude them. Why, under such circumstances, any resistance would be himsa.
After all physical himsa is only a development of mental himsa. If it is a sin to
contemplate the worsting of a thief or a robber or any enemy, of course, it is a greater
sin to resist him by force. The thing is so absurd on the face of it, that I feel inclined
to doubt the accuracy of the report of Mr Gandhi’s speech. But the Press has been
freely commenting on the speech and Mr Gandhi issued no disclaimer. In any case I
feel that I cannot sit silent and let this doctrine go as an unquestioned sublime truth to
be followed by Young India, so long as the speech remains uncontradicted or
unexplained Mr. Gandhi wants to create a world of imaginary perfection. Of course he
is free to do it, as he is free to ask others to do it. But in the same way I consider it my
duty to point out his error.

April 13, 1917
DEAR MR. GANDHI,

We entirely corroborate your statement made by you today to the
Commissioner (Tirhut Division) that you have come to this division at the request of
the public men of the province to investigate the question of the relations between
the indigo planters and Indian raiyats and give us the benefit of your expert
assistance in any way you can We were party to the invitation. We further corroborate
your statement that you were asked by most of us to move the resolution in the matter
before the last Congress but that you declined to do so on the ground that you had not
studied the question on the spot. We invited you because we thought that having
expert experience you would be the best and most proper person to make a thorough
constitutional and impartial inquiry into the matter which would be to the interest of
the parties concerned.
Yours sincerely,

Hon’ble Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Mr. Gandhi to go to Muzaffarpur and
Champaran and study the question about the planters and the raiyats. They promised
to visit Muzaffarpur as early as possible. Mr. Gandhi was also requested by Bihar

THE DIST. M AGISTRATE OF CHAMPARAN
SIR,

Mr. M. K. Gandhi has come here in response to what he describes as
an insistent public demand to inquire into the conditions under which Indians workon
indigo plantations and desires the help of the local administration. He came to see me
this morning and I explained that the relations between the planters and the ryots had
engaged the attention of the administration since the sixties, and that we were
particularly concerned with a phase of the problem in Champaran now; but that it was
doubtful whether the intervention of a stranger in the middle of the treatment of our
case would not prove an embarrassment. I indicated the potentialities of disturbances
in Champaran, asked for credentials to show an insistent public demand for his
inquiry and said that the matter would probably need reference to Government.
I expected that Mr. Gandhi would communicate with me again before he
proceeds to Champaran but I have been informed since our interview that his object is
likely to be agitation rather than a genuine search for knowledge and it is possible
that he may proceed without further reference. I consider that there is a danger of

to request you to direct him by an order under section 144 Cr. P. C. to leave it at once

APPENDIX V
NOTE BY HON’BLE W. MAUDE ON INTERVIEW WITH GANDHIJI
May 10, 1917

*

*

*

On the 10th May I had a very long talk with Mr. Gandhi....
Our conversation was extremely frank and discursive and I cannot attempt to
reproduce the gist of it all. The upshot of it was that when I suggested that he must
have got a very considerable amount of evidence together by now and might be in a
position to make his report, he consented at once to send up a preliminary report, and
in the meantime to stop the recording of evidence by his assistants and only make
enquiries quietly by himself, visiting only fresh dehats where he is especially invited
either by the planter or by the raiyats. I suggested that he should dispense with the
services of his assistants and he said he could not make any definite promise about
that, and that he was really grieved at the want of faith in the motives and intentions
of those assistants. He insisted that if anyone believed that they were regarding it or
talking about it behind the scenes as an anti-European movement, they would be quite
mistaken as there was no suggestion of such a thing. He said he had intended to lay
certain definite proposals before the planters which if they accepted he would be able
to destroy all his papers and go away; but he admitted that he did not think it would be
much use, and that one or two suggestions he had made to planters individually had
not met with the response which he had hoped for. I said I did not think it would be
the slightest use his approaching the planters, and he could scarcely expect them to
regard him as in any way authorised to lay proposals of any kind before them. It
would be better if he wrote a report on such materials as he had already collected and
sent it to Government or to the Government of India if he preferred that channel. He
said he hadn’t the slightest desire to go to the Government of India and his idea had
been to approach the planters themselves first, if they failed to go to the local
officers, if they didn’t satisfy him to the Local Government, if they did not satisfy
him to the Government of India, and if they didn’t satisfy him to appeal as a last
resort to pubic opinion in India.

In conclusion, he asked to whom he ought to address his report, to the
Collector or Commissioner or Local Government. I said it would perhaps be best if he
addressed it to the Government as it would relieve the Collector and Commissioner of
the necessity of wondering whether they were called on to discuss it in sending it up.
He would send a copy to the local officers as a matter of courtesy, and Government
could call for any remarks or information as might appear advisable. I said it had been
rumoured that he intended to subject Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga to the same process
as Champaran, and he said he had so far never had any such intention, though he
might visit other parts of the province in a general way in order to complete his
knowledge of India generally. I specially commended to his notice a visit to the
South of Gaya and the adjoining parts of Hazaribagh where he would find a condition
of tenantry in comparison with which the Champaran raiyats are independent and
courageous. We wound up a two hours’ conversation with a most interesting talk of
the Colonial emigration question which, however, does not concern this file.

Rai.
My age is nearly 50 years, my wife is alive. I have one son and three
daughters. I have 5 bighas in Chailabhar and 1_ bighas under Belwa Kothi. I have had
nearly 2_ kathas of zirat forced on me. I have offered through Mr. Gandhi to surrender
the zirat. Yesterday about 10 a.m. Mr. Holttum came near my house. On seeing him I
went to him. He was on horseback. He had the Patwari Ramlagan Lal and Tahsildar
Amla Singh and three peons with him. Several people had collected there. Mr.
Holttum addressed us all and said “You have surrendered your zirat. What is there now
between you and me? You will have to pay for it. I shall charge you annas 12 per
buffalo and annas 8 per ox and annas 4 per cow for grazing in the Parti. If you do not
pay, I shall impound your cattle. You will also have to grow indigo.” We have not
been obliged to pay anything up to now for grazing cattle. We listened but said
nothing. He spoke to his men and went away.

I have a wife, I have no children. I am 40 years old. I have 3_ bighas land in
Shikarpur. I have had 2_ kathas of Zirat forced on me. This was about 10 years ago. I
have in common with many others offered through Mr. Gandhi to surrender my zirat.
I was present on the day Mr. Gandhi came to Saraswa. About 6 o’clock in the evening
I was passing by Dhokaraha factory on my way to Shikarpur. The Kacheri of the
Factory is situated in its compound. A passer-by could get a clear view of the Kacheri
as I did. I saw Sukhari Mahton on the verandah. He was standing by a bundle of papers
on the floor of the verandah. I know that the Kacheri has been burnt down. I do not
believe that it is the work of the raiyats.
